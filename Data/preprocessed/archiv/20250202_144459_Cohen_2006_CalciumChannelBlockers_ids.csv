Because of this, we hypothesized that irbesartan would reduce QT dispersion to a greater degree than amlodipine, a highly selective vasodilator. To test this, we gathered electrocardiographic (ECG) data from a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind parallel group study that compared the antihypertensive efficacy of irbesartan and amlodipine in elderly subjects with mild to moderate hypertension. Subjects were treated for 6 months with either drug. Hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol were added after 12 weeks if blood pressure (BP) remained uncontrolled. ECGs were obtained before randomization and at 6 months. A total of 188 subjects (118 with baseline ECGs) were randomized. We analyzed 104 subjects who had complete ECGs at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. Baseline characteristics between treatments were similar, apart from a slight imbalance in diastolic BP (irbesartan [n=53] versus amlodipine [n=51], 99.2 [SD 3. 6] versus 100.8 [3.8] mm Hg; P=0.03). There were no significant differences in BP normalization (diastolic BP <90 mm Hg) between treatments at 6 months (irbesartan versus amlodipine, 80% versus 88%; P=0.378). We found a significant reduction in QT indexes in the irbesartan group (QTc dispersion mean, -11.4 [34.5] milliseconds, P=0.02; QTc max, -12.8 [35.5] milliseconds, P=0.01), and QTc dispersion did not correlate with the change in BP. The reduction in QT indexes with amlodipine (QTc dispersion, -9.7 [35.4] milliseconds, P=0.06; QTc max, -8.6 [33.2] milliseconds, P=0.07) did not quite reach statistical significance, but there was a correlation between the change in QT indexes and changes in systolic BP. In conclusion, irbesartan improved QT dispersion, and this effect may be important in preventing sudden cardiac death in at-risk hypertensive subjects."

It is characterized by cervical effacement and/or dilatation and increased uterine irritability before 37 weeks of gestation. Women with a history of preterm labor are at greatest risk. Strategies for reducing the incidence of preterm labor and delivery have focused on educating both physicians and patients about the risks for preterm labor and methods of detecting preterm cervical dilatation. Methods used to predict preterm labor include weekly cervical assessment, transvaginal ultrasonography, detection of fetal fibronectin and home uterine activity monitoring. As yet, it is unclear if any of these strategies should be routinely employed. At present, management of preterm labor may include the use of tocolytic agents, corticosteroids and antibiotics."

The Captopril Prevention Project (CAPPP) is a randomised intervention trial to compare the effects of ACE inhibition and conventional therapy on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension. CAPPP was a prospective, randomised, open trial with blinded endpoint evaluation. 10,985 patients were enrolled at 536 health centres in Sweden and Finland. Patients aged 25-66 years with a measured diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or more on two occasions were randomly assigned captopril or conventional antihypertensive treatment (diuretics, beta-blockers). Analysis was by intention-to-treat. The primary endpoint was a composite of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular deaths. Of 5492 patients assigned captopril and 5493 assigned conventional therapy, 14 and 13, respectively, were lost to follow-up. Primary endpoint events occurred in 363 patients in the captopril group (11.1 per 1000 patient-years) and 335 in the conventional-treatment group (10.2 per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 1.05 [95% CI 0.90-1.22], p=0-52). Cardiovascular mortality was lower with captopril than with conventional treatment (76 vs 95 events; relative risk 0.77 [0.57-1-04], p=0.092), the rate of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction was similar (162 vs 161), but fatal and non-fatal stroke was more common with captopril (189 vs 148; 1.25 [1-01-1-55]. p=0.044). Captopril and conventional treatment did not differ in efficacy in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The difference in stroke risk is probably due to the lower levels of blood pressure obtained initially in previously treated patients randomised to conventional therapy."

Although there have been several studies examining this question, the results are conflicting, with previous estimates ranging from 20% to 83%. There have been only 2 studies examining the prevalence of overgrowth induced by diltiazem and amlodipine, with estimates of 74% and 3.3%, respectively. The current study aimed to address the problems associated with these studies by examining a sample of patients taking one of 3 calcium channel blockers, who were drawn from a community-based population in northeastern England. Nine hundred eleven (911) subjects were recruited from general medical practices in the area. Of these, 442 were taking nifedipine, 181 amlodipine, and 186 diltiazem. In addition, 102 control subjects were examined. Drug and demographic data for each subject were recorded. The periodontal condition of all subjects was assessed including plaque index, papillary bleeding index, and a photograph of the anterior gingivae for subsequent analysis of overgrowth severity. More than six percent (6.3%) of subjects taking nifedipine were seen to have significant overgrowth. This overgrowth was statistically greater than the amount of overgrowth seen in either of the other 2 drug groups or the control population. The prevalence of gingival overgrowth induced by amlodipine or diltiazem was not statistically significant when compared to the control group. The severity of overgrowth within the nifedipine group was found to be related to the amount of gingival inflammation and also to the gender of the subject, with males being 3 times as likely to develop overgrowth than females. The prevalence of clinically significant overgrowth related to chronic medication with calcium channel blockers is low, i.e., 6.3% for nifedipine. Males are 3 times as likely as females to develop clinically significant overgrowth. The presence of gingival inflammation is an important cofactor for the expression of this effect."

Systolic Hypertension in Europe Trial Investigators.,"Recent reports suggest that calcium-channel blockers may be harmful in patients with diabetes and hypertension. We previously reported that antihypertensive treatment with the calcium-channel blocker nitrendipine reduced the risk of cardiovascular events. In this post hoc analysis, we compared the outcome of treatment with nitrendipine in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. After stratification according to center, sex, and presence or absence of previous cardiovascular complications, 4695 patients (age, > or =60 years) with systolic blood pressure of 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic pressure below 95 mm Hg were randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo. Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10 to 40 mg per day) with the possible addition or substitution of enalapril (5 to 20 mg per day) or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 25 mg per day) or both, titrated to reduce the systolic blood pressure by at least 20 mm Hg and to less than 150 mm Hg. In the control group, matching placebo tablets were administered similarly. At randomization, 492 patients (10.5 percent) had diabetes. After a median follow-up of two years, the systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the placebo and active-treatment groups differed by 8.6 and 3.9 mm Hg, respectively, among the diabetic patients. Among the 4203 patients without diabetes, systolic and diastolic pressures differed by 10.3 and 4.5 mm Hg, respectively, in the two groups. After adjustment for possible confounders, active treatment was found to have reduced overall mortality by 55 percent (from 45.1 deaths per 1000 patients to 26.4 deaths per 1000 patients), mortality from cardiovascular disease by 76 percent, all cardiovascular events combined by 69 percent, fatal and nonfatal strokes by 73 percent, and all cardiac events combined by 63 percent in the group of patients with diabetes. Among the nondiabetic patients, active treatment decreased all cardiovascular events combined by 26 percent and fatal and nonfatal strokes by 38 percent. In the group of patients receiving active treatment, reductions in overall mortality, mortality from cardiovascular disease, and all cardiovascular events were significantly larger among the diabetic patients than among the nondiabetic patients (P=0.04, P=0.02, and P=0.01, respectively). Nitrendipine-based antihypertensive therapy is particularly beneficial in older patients with diabetes and isolated systolic hypertension. Thus, our findings do not support the hypothesis that the use of long-acting calcium-channel blockers may be harmful in diabetic patients."

Twenty-nine asymptomatic essential hypertensive patients (nine men, 20 women) with a mean age of 55.03+/-11.19 years and baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of > or =120 mm Hg after resting 30 min, not taking antihypertensive drugs for the last 24 h, were randomized in a single-blind fashion to receive lacidipine, 4 mg (LCD, 15 patients) or short-acting nifedipine, 20 mg (NFD, 14 patients) in a single dose. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were taken every 30 min during the first 8 h and every 2 h until 24 h of follow-up. Baseline BP values were similar in the two groups (LCD, 222.5+/-32.8/124.6+/-8.4 mm Hg vs. NFD, 215.9+/-20.6/128+/-7.7 mm Hg; p = NS). Both drugs promoted a significant reduction of systolic blood pressure (SBP; 169.6+/-27.8 vs. 170.6+/-25.3 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP; 104.1+/-16 vs. 102.9+/-12.4 mm Hg) after 8 h. However, either SBP (165+/-27.3 vs. 190.6+/-18.2 mm Hg; p = 0.008) and DBP (99.9+/-12.3 vs. 117.2+/-11.4 mm Hg; p = 0.001) were significantly higher in the NFD group after 24-h dosing. Eleven patients in the LCD group had a decrease in BP >25% of the baseline value both 8 and 24 h after the dose. Although 10 patients showed the same response in the NFD group 8 h after the dose, only four patients maintained these values at 24 h. One patient treated with NFD had a transient cerebrovascular ischemic attack. No adverse effects were observed in the LCD group. We conclude that the long-acting calcium antagonist lacidipine was more effective than the short-acting nifedipine in both controlling BP and maintaining this BP reduction over 8 h in essential hypertensive patients with acute asymptomatic BP increase."

A total of 551 patients with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia and evidence of coronary artery disease were randomized to a 4-week, forced-dose titration treatment period with (1) COER-24 verapamil 240 mg titrated to 480 mg at bedtime (n = 173), (2) amlodipine 5 mg titrated to 10 mg/day (n = 149), (3) amlodipine 5 mg (titrated to 10 mg) plus atenolol 50 mg/day in the A.M. (n = 154), or (4) placebo (n = 75). Treadmill exercise tolerance testing (standard Bruce protocol), and 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring were performed at the end of placebo lead-in and double-blind treatment. Each active treatment significantly improved symptom-limited exercise duration and time to moderate angina (p < or = 0.01 vs placebo). For patients with baseline ischemia, amlodipine resulted in a statistically significant increase in total duration of ischemic episodes compared with placebo, whereas COER-24 verapamil and amlodipine plus atenolol resulted in statistically significant decreases compared with placebo and amlodipine. Heart rate at onset of ischemic episodes and ST product were also significantly increased with amlodipine (p < 0.05) compared with either COER-24 or amlodipine plus atenolol. COER-24 and amlodipine alone or in combination with atenolol improved exercise capacity in patients with angina pectoris. COER-24 verapamil monotherapy or amlodipine plus atenolol combination therapy were more effective than amlodipine monotherapy in decreasing ambulatory myocardial ischemia, especially during the hours of 6 A.M. to 12 noon."

Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents.,"Concern based on the reported short-term adverse effects of antihypertensive agents on plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles (PLPPs) has complicated the therapy for hypertension. To compare the long-term (1-year) effects of 6 different antihypertensive drugs and placebo on PLPPs in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial in 15 US Veterans Affairs medical centers. A total of 1292 ambulatory men, 21 years or older, with diastolic blood pressures (DBPs) ranging from 95 to 109 mm Hg taking placebo were randomized to receive placebo or 1 of 6 antihypertensive drugs: hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, or prazosin. After drug titration, patients with a DBP of less than 90 mm Hg were followed up for 1 year. Plasma lipids and lipoprotein profiles were determined at baseline, after initial titration, and at 1 year. After 8 weeks on a regimen of hydrochlorothiazide, increases of 3.3 mg/dL (0.09 mmol/L) in total cholesterol and 2.7 mg/dL in apolipoprotein B were significantly different (P< or =.05) from decreases of 9.3 mg/dL in total cholesterol and 5.4 mg/dL in ApoB levels while receiving prazosin but not from placebo. Patients achieving positive DBP control using hydrochlorothiazide (responders) showed no adverse changes in PLPPs, whereas nonresponders exhibited increases in triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Plasma lipids and lipoprotein profiles did not change significantly among treatment groups after 1 year except for minor decreases in high-density lipoprotein 2 levels using hydrochlorothiazide, clonidine, and atenolol. None of these 6 antihypertensive drugs has any long-term adverse effects on PLPPs and, therefore, may be safely prescribed. Previously reported short-term adverse effects from using hydrochlorothiazide are limited to nonresponders."

Treatment target was a sitting DBP < 95 mm Hg by the 9th week of treatment. This was followed by a 4-month open phase using nisoldipine CC 10 to 60 mg daily. Ninety-six patients had complete data at baseline, and at the end of the double-blind and open phases, and were included in this analysis. In both groups, all patients required titration up to the maximal dose of double-blind medication. Monotherapy with nisoldipine CC, but not enalapril, significantly reduced both sitting and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP). Twenty-four-hour BP in the nisoldipine CC group decreased from 179+/-14 / 118+/-7 to 144+/-16 / 94+/-10 mm Hg (P < .0001) versus 181+/-13 / 117+/-5 to 171+/-17 / 110+/-11 mm Hg in the enalapril group (P = ns). The profound decrease in blood pressure achieved with nisoldipine CC was accompanied by a significant reduction in left ventricular [LV] mass index, observed after only 2 months of treatment (from 146+/-40 to 129+/-35 g/m2, P = .05). In contrast, enalapril had no effect on LV mass (from 139+/-36 to 142+/-50 g/m2, P = NS). The antihypertensive effect of nisoldipine CC was further demonstrated in the open phase, during which 24-h BP decreased from 180+/-14 / 118+/-6 mm Hg (at baseline) to 142+/-16 / 92+/-10 mm Hg at the end of the 16-week open phase (P < .0001). This effect was sustained with trough-to-peak ratio of 74% for systolic and 67% for diastolic BP, with further regression in LV mass. Reduction in 24-h systolic BP to < 135 mm Hg was associated with a greater degree of regression of LV mass index in patients treated with nisoldipine CC. The incidence of adverse events in both groups was low and both nisoldipine CC and enalapril were well tolerated. The incidence of significant ventricular arrhythmia was also low and did not change with treatment. In conclusion, our findings suggest that nisoldipine CC administered once daily could be considered as a suitable first-line antihypertensive agent in black patients with severe hypertension, based on its profound and sustained blood-pressure-lowering effect, associated with significant regression of left ventricular mass and its low side effect profile."

A double blind study in salt-sensitive black hypertensives].,"To evaluate whether the additional antihypertensive efficacy of the nifedipine-thiazide combination depends on the sequence of drug administration and whether the natriuretic effect of thiazide persists when co-administered with nifedipine. Double blind, randomised, crossover, placebo-controlled study, in 12 salt-sensitive hypertensive black patients (SSH). Evaluation of the antihypertensive (24 h ambulatory monitoring) and natriuretic effects of placebo (PL), of nifedipine-GITS (NIF, 30 mg/d) and of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ, 25 mg/d) given alone and in combination within two separate therapeutic sequences: PL-->NIF-->NIF + HCTZ and PL-->HCTZ-->HCTZ + NIF (1 month for each therapeutic regimen). NIF induced greater (p < 0.04) reduction of 24 h mean arterial pressure (MAP) (-15.9 +/- 1.9 mm Hg, v PL) than HCTZ (-9.0 +/- 1.3 mm Hg). The association of NIF to HCTZ induced a greater (p < 0.05) additional reduction of MAP-24 h (9.7 +/- 2.2 mm Hg) than that produced by the association of HCTZ to NIF (4.1 +/- 1.3 mm Hg). NIF alone and in combination did not modify the diuresis-natriuresis observed with the previous treatment, whereas HCTZ alone and in combination always increased diuresis (by 25%) and natriuresis (by 53%). There was a significant negative correlation (r = -0.71, p < 0.001) between blood pressure (BP) reduction induced by the drug administered first (NIF or HCTZ) and the additional BP reduction obtained by the association of the second drug. In most of the SSH the NIF-GITS was more potent than HCTZ. NIF did not modify the diuretic-natriuretic effect of PL and of HCTZ. The greater potency of NIF may explain why in most patients the combination HCTZ to NIF induced a lower hypotensive effect than that of the association of NIF to HCTZ. Independently of the sequence of the drug administration, the lower the hypotensive effect of the drug administered first the greater the additional hypotensive effect that was observed by adding the second drug."

To test this, we evaluated 20 patients with severe heart failure (mean age, 55 +/- 13 years; New York Heart Association functional class III; left ventricular ejection fraction, 18% +/- 8% on maintenance therapy with captopril, digoxin, and diuretics) who were randomized to nicardipine (60 or 90 mg/d) or placebo during a 4-month double-blind protocol. The following measurements were obtained at baseline, monthly, and at 4 months or last follow-up visit: rest and exercise radionuclide ventriculography, maximal treadmill time, 6-minute walking test distance, serum norepinephrine and aldosterone concentrations, and plasma renin activity. During the follow-up period, worsening of heart failure occurred in 6 patients in the nicardipine group and in 2 patients in the placebo group (p = 0.06). The maximal treadmill time for a 6-minute walking distance and exercise radionuclide ejection fraction at the last follow-up visit did not change in patients who did not deteriorate with heart failure in the placebo or nicardipine groups as compared with baseline values. In this study group of patients with severe heart failure receiving therapy with digoxin, captopril, and diuretics, nicardipine was associated with worsening heart failure without an apparent activation of the neurohormones. However, because of the small number of patients and a significant number of patients who deteriorated during the follow-up period, no definitive conclusions can be made."

All drugs were titrated to a diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or less. Both studies were double-blind, randomized, parallel dose escalation trials with similar designs and included three active treatments. The second study also had a placebo group. The mean change from baseline of systolic and diastolic blood pressure for placebo (n = 79) was -0. 1/-2.2 mm Hg; amlodipine (n = 154), -12.4/-10.3 mm Hg; enalapril (n = 155), -9.4/-8.2 mm Hg; and bisoprolol/HCTZ (n = 155), -14.0/-12.0. Overall efficacy analyses documented a statistically significant decrease in sitting diastolic blood pressure for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ compared with placebo, amlodipine, and enalapril. There was a significant reduction in sitting systolic blood pressure for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ compared with placebo and enalapril but not amlodipine. Also, there was a significant decrease in sitting heart rate for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ (-6.2 beats/min) compared with placebo (+0.1 beats/min), amlodipine (+1.2 beats/min), and enalapril (+0.5 beats/min). The control rate (diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) for bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ (66.5%) was significantly better than for placebo (21.8%) and enalapril (47.1%) but not amlodipine (58.4%). Of those patients achieving and maintaining control, 49% of the bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ subjects were on the lowest two doses compared with 30% of the amlodipine and 26% of the enalapril subjects. Percentages of patients reporting at least one drug-related adverse event through week 12 were 27%, 24%, 28%, and 25% for placebo, bisoprolol/6.25 mg HCTZ, amlodipine, and enalapril (not significant). Lower doses of two drugs in fixed combination can provide as good or better blood pressure control compared with higher doses of a single drug with similar tolerability and safety."

Changes with calcium-blocker treatment in clinic and 24-h blood pressure (BP), heart rate, BP variability, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) by three methods (Valsalva manoeuvre, phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside injection), and in baroreflex- and non-baroreflex-mediated reflexes (tilt and cold face stimulus) were studied in 14 elderly subjects (mean age [+/- SEM] 70 +/- 1 years) with sustained isolated systolic hypertension (clinic BP 179 +/- 3/85 +/- 1 mm Hg). Clinic systolic BP, but not diastolic BP, was reduced with treatment (by 14 +/- 6 mm Hg, P = 0.03, diastolic BP 4 +/- 3 mm Hg, P = 0.16). Twenty-four hour BP was also reduced by nifedipine treatment (by 18 +/- 3/9 +/- 2 mm Hg, both P < 0.001). Clinic and 24-h heart rate, and daytime BP variability, were unchanged with treatment. BRS was significantly increased during nifedipine therapy by all three measurement methods (all P < 0.05). With 60 degrees tilt during active treatment, subjects exhibited a greater heart rate increase (P < 0.01), and a reduced fall in systolic (P < 0.05) and diastolic BP (P < 0.05). Thus despite the arteriosclerosis and reductions in large artery compliance described in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension, clinically important improvements in clinic and ambulatory BP and some aspects of cardiovascular homeostasis can be achieved with calcium-channel blocking therapy."

This is a multicentre, two-way parallel-group, open-label comparative study in 90 overweight hypertensive patients, who were randomly assigned to treatment for 8 weeks with either trandolapril or nifedipine. At baseline and after treatment, all patients underwent an oral glucose tolerance test, an evaluation of their metabolic profiles and a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp test. In a subgroup of 18 patients, a forearm study was carried out. Blood pressure fell by the second week of treatment and remained significantly reduced compared with baseline in both treatment groups. Plasma triglyceride levels were also significantly reduced after trandolapril therapy, but no significant changes occurred in the other metabolic parameters during treatment with either drug. During the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp, whole-body glucose use was similar in the two treatment groups at baseline, and a moderate but statistically significant increase in insulin sensitivity was observed after trandolapril treatment (trandolapril: 5.0 +/- 0.2 versus 4.5 +/- 0.2 mg/kg per min; nifedipine: 4.1 +/- 0.3 versus 4.2 +/- 0.3 mg/kg per min; P < 0.05, versus baseline and trandolapril versus nifedipine treatment). Skeletal muscle glucose uptake was significantly higher after trandolapril than after nifedipine therapy (5.0 +/- 0.7 and 3.0 +/- 0.4 mg/min, respectively; P < 0.01). As forearm blood flow was similar in the two treatment groups at baseline and was unchanged after 8 weeks of therapy, skeletal muscle glucose extraction was significantly greater in the ACE inhibitor treated-group than in the nifedipine comparative group (trandolapril: baseline 21 +/- 2, treatment 24 +/- 3 mg/dl; nifedipine: baseline 18 +/- 3, treatment 16 +/- 2 mg/dl; P < 0.05, trandolapril versus nifedipine treatment). During short-term treatment, ACE inhibition with trandolapril was able to moderately improve insulin sensitivity, in comparison with calcium blockade, and this effect appeared to be independent of the haemodynamic action of the drug."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10158113,,https://openalex.org/W2406071529,0,Efficacy of preconditioning with intracoronary diltiazem in preventing laser-induced spasm.,"Laser energy produces a multitude of effects, resulting both in therapeutic tissue ablation and complications such as laser-induced spasm (LIS). LIS can occur during lasing itself or during subsequent adjunctive angioplasty. Intracoronary diltiazem (ICD) can partially reverse LIS after it occurs. To determine whether pre-treatment with ICD might prevent LIS during laser interventions, 3 groups of 50 lesions each were studied. Group 1 served as controls receiving no ICD during the procedure. Group 2 received 2.5 mg ICD before lasing. Group 3 received ICD before lasing and then a second infusion of 2.5 mg ICD after lasing but before adjunctive therapy. There were no differences in clinical characteristics of the 3 groups. Over 75% of lesions in each group were complex (B2 or C) lesions, and average lesion length was 15 mm in all 3 groups. Procedural success was > or = 94% in all groups. There was no significant difference among groups in pre-procedure artery stenosis, post-procedure stenosis, laser power used or number of laser pulses delivered. Pretreatment with ICD produced vasodilation of the minimum lumen diameter from 0.86 +/- 0.1 to 1.0 +/- 0.1 mm (p < 0.01) and was well tolerated. Control patients exhibited a 12% incidence of LIS. Group 2 had an 80% reduction of LIS during lasing (p < 0.01) but had increased LIS during adjunctive therapy with the same 12% incidence of LIS overall. Group 3 had only a 2% incidence of LIS (p < 0.01). We concluded that pretreatment with ICD significantly reduces LIS. Multiple infusions of ICD are necessary to sustain this protective effect."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10172139,,https://openalex.org/W131874683,0,Incidence of adverse drug reactions in adult medical inpatients.,"This study was a prospective observational study of ADR occurrence and evaluation in adult internal medicine inpatients conducted over a 120-day period. Clinical pharmacists screened for ADRs at a county hospital in Indianapolis, IN. Patient information was reviewed on admission, every four days during hospitalization, and at discharge. ADRs occurring after hospital admission were assessed for causality, severity, pharmacological type (i.e., augmented pharmacology versus idiosyncratic reaction) and affected organ system. Nurse and pharmacist reports, incident reports, physician consults, patient transfers to critical care units, and serum drug concentration reports were additional means of ADR identification. Overall, 23.1% of patients experienced an ADR while 2.6% of the 11,702 drug exposures resulted in an ADR. Patients aged greater than 65 years (29.6% vs. 20.5% for younger patients) and females (26.2% vs. 20% for males) were at higher risk for ADR development (p < 0.05). Length of hospital stay was longer (13.3 days vs. 6.7 days; p < 0.05) and drug exposures more frequent for patients experiencing ADRs (p < 0.001). Furosemide elicited the most ADRs with 36 in 244 patient exposures (14.7%). Diltiazem, enalapril, heparin, trimterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination and captopril were also frequently implicated. ADRs were classified as mild (35.9%), moderate (52.6%), and severe (10.2%). Organ systems most commonly affected were the metabolic/hematologic (32.9%), gastrointestinal (17.8%), genitourinary (11.8%), and cardiovascular (10.5%). Over 30% of events were idiosyncratic reactions. ADR incidence was consistent with previous literature. Many frequently implicated medications were newer agents and the severity of events was less than previously reported."
