The sulphur analogue shows typical saturation kinetics with a K(m) value of 2.4mm and V(max.) value of 70mumol/h per g of cell water. Uptake of 5-thio-d-glucose is phlorrhizin-sensitive, Na(+)-dependent and energy-dependent. d-Galactose and methyl alpha-d-glucopyranoside transport is competitively inhibited by 5-thio-d-glucose with K(i) values of 4.8 and 9.7mm respectively. 5-Thio-d-glucose thus shows all of the characteristics of active transport in kidney cortex. Transport of neutral amino acids in rat kidney cortex is inhibited by 5-thio-d-glucose. Thus 5.6mm-5-thio-d-glucose causes a 25-30% inhibition of the transport of glycine and the non-metabolized amino acids cycloleucine and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid. 5-Thio-d-glucose is freely taken up by the facilitated-diffusion transport system in rat diaphragm muscle. The sulphur analogue inhibits the transport of d-xylose in this tissue but has no effect on the uptake of d-arabinose. It is concluded that the ring heteroatom is not an effector of binding in the transport processes examined and causes no important alteration in the conformation of the sugar. The diabetogenic action produced by 5-thio-d-glucose is due, in part, to the ability of the analogue to interfere with cellular transport processes that use d-glucose."

The activity of 3 beta-, 17 beta- and 20 alpha-steroid dehydrogenases, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NAD and NADP-diaphorases, esterase, acid and alkaline phosphatases was studied. It has been shown that transport alterations in the microcirculation including the hematofollicular barrier play, the leading part in age-dependent depression of reproductive and endocrine functions. Ageing rats demonstrated no linkage between endothelial, thecal and granular cells, which points to the injury of the histophysiological mechanisms of the follicular system integration."

Accordingly, here we examined the late effects of uncontrollable stress, a presumptive model of depression and/or traumatic disorder, on panic-like behaviors evoked by electrical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG). Changes in anxiety and depression were also assessed in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and forced-swimming test (FST), respectively. Rats with electrodes in the DPAG were subjected to a 7-day shuttle-box one-way escape yoked training with foot-shocks either escapable (ES) or inescapable (IS). The day after the end of one-way escape training, rats were trained in a two-way escape novel task (test-session) to ascertain the effectiveness of uncontrollable stress. DPAG stimulations were carried out in an open field, both before the escape training and 2 and 7 days after it, and EPM and FST were performed on the 8th and 10th days afterwards, respectively. Controls were either trained with fictive shocks (FS) or subjected to intracranial stimulations only. Although the ES rats performed significantly better than the IS group in the two-way escape task, groups did not differ with respect to either the anxiety or depression scores. Unexpectedly, however, IS rats showed a marked attenuation of DPAG-evoked freezing and flight behaviors relative to both the ES and FS groups, 2 and 7 days after one-way escape training. The conjoint inhibition of passive (freezing) and active (flight) defensive behaviors suggests that IS inhibits a DPAG in-built motivational system that may be implicated in depressed patients' difficulties in coping with daily-life stress."

Prospective, controlled, and randomized animal study. A university research laboratory. Male adult rats were subjected to polymicrobial sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture or sham operation followed by the administration of normal saline solution. At 1 hr after cecal ligation and puncture, glycine (0.6 mmol/kg) or vehicle (normal saline solution) was administered intravenously over 15 mins. At 5 hrs after cecal ligation and puncture (i.e., early stage of sepsis), hepatocellular function (i.e., the maximal velocity and efficiency of in vivo indocyanine green clearance) was determined and hepatocyte injury was assessed by measuring plasma concentrations of alpha-gluthathione S-transferase. Serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In additional animals, the necrotic cecum was excised at 20 hrs after cecal ligation and puncture, the peritoneal cavity was irrigated with saline, and the midline incision was closed in layers. Mortality was monitored for 10 days thereafter. The results indicate that hepatocellular function was depressed in the early stage of sepsis (i.e., 5 hrs after cecal ligation and puncture) as indicated by significant decreases in both maximal velocity and transport efficiency of in vivo indocyanine green clearance. Plasma concentrations of alpha-gluthathione S-transferase and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were elevated significantly at that interval after cecal ligation and puncture. Administration of glycine 1 hr after cecal ligation and puncture, however, increased maximal velocity and maximal efficiency by 60% and 101% (p <.05), respectively. Glycine administration in septic animals decreased alpha-gluthathione S-transferase and tumor necrosis factor-alpha by 43% and 80% (p <.05). In addition, glycine treatment decreased the mortality rate from 50% to 0% (p <.05) at 10 days after cecal ligation and puncture and cecal excision. It appears that the beneficial effect of glycine on hepatocyte function and integrity in sepsis may be mediated via down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Because administration of glycine attenuated hepatocellular depression and injury during early sepsis and decreased sepsis-induced mortality rates, this amino acid appears to be a useful adjunct for maintaining cellular functions and preventing lethality from polymicrobial sepsis."

There has been increasing interest in its therapeutic application in depression. However, the mechanisms behind behavioural changes are still poorly understood. Chronic mild stress (CMS)-induced preference behaviour change has been used as a model to predict the clinical efficacy of many types of antidepressant treatment. Both EtOH and water extracts (AE and WE) of Banxia-houpu decoction exhibited a significantly increased sucrose intake in the CMS model in rats, but there was no effect in unstressed animals. In the present study, it was found that the c-fos expression in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum corpora were very high in the CMS model in rats. WE and AE at a dose of 130 mg/kg exhibited a significantly decreased c-fos expression in the cerebral regions in CMS model in rats, respectively. The former was more potent than the latter. However, no significant changes in the c-fos expression were observed in unstressed rats treated with the decoction. Fluoxetine not only significantly reduced c-fos expression in all regions in the CMS model in rats, but only showed a marked decrease in c-fos expression in the hippocampus in unstressed animals. A different molecular mechanism of Banxia-houpu decoction and fluoxetine may be implied. The cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum conpora might be important structural substrates in the central nervous system mediating the section of the Banxia-houpu decoction on preference behaviour in CMS-induced rats, and fos protein might be the common substrate of the signal transduction process of the decoction."

Several animal models of depression have been introduced, however, only a few have been extensively validated. In the present study we report the results of investigations into monoaminergic receptors in the brain of rats subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) procedure (one of the well validated animal models of depression). We have examined the dopaminergic (D-1, D-2), adrenergic (alpha-1, beta-1) and serotonergic (5HT-1A, 5HT-2A) receptors in different brain regions by a saturation radioligand binding method in rats subjected to CUS paradigm and control animals. CUS procedure resulted in a significant 29% increase in the D-1 receptor density in the limbic system and 52% increase of the density of 5HT-2A receptors in the cerebral cortex. The present data indicate that the increase of the density of brain D-1 and 5HT-2A receptors of rats subjected to CUS might be involved in the pathophysiology of ""animal depression"" (since chronic antidepressant treatment produced opposite changes i.e. decrease in the density of these receptors) and thus in pathophysiology of human depression."

In muscle and brain, the activity of GP remained constant throughout the year when tested at 25°C. In contrast, the activities of liver and heart GP displayed striking increases in summer. When seasonal temperature changes are taken into account, the activity of GP during the anoxic mid-winter is only 4-6% of its summer time activity in the muscle, heart and liver, and 13% in brain. In winter-acclimatized fish, experimental anoxia (1-6 weeks) caused sustained depression of the GP activity in heart and gills. In liver and muscle, a transient depression of GP activity occurred during the first week of anoxia but later GP activity recovered back to the normoxic level. GP of the brain was completely resistant to anoxia. In all studied tissues, the constitutive activity of GP is more than sufficient to degrade glycogen deposits during winter anoxia without anoxia-induced activation of GP. The seemingly paradoxical summer-time increase in the activity of liver and heart GP could be related to active life-style of the summer-acclimatized fish (growth, reproduction), the increased demand of energy and molecular precursors of anabolic metabolism being satisfied by preferential degradation of glycogen. The high glycogen content of winter-acclimatized crucian carp is not associated with the elevated GP activity or anoxic activation of GP."

Two dogs served as control, 4 received 2 mg lead/kg daily and 4 received 5 mg lead/kg/daily. Lead was administered for 13 weeks, after which one-half of each experimental group was treated with calcium ethylene diaminetetraacetate (CaEDTA) for 5 days. All animals were then monitored for another 4 weeks. Blood lead levels, haematology, blood glutathione concentration, and the number of bone marrow cells with stainable iron granules were measured weekly during the 18-week experimental period. Clinical signs of poisoning were observed only in one dog in the high dose group after 6 weeks. The signed included emaciation, anorexia, muscular weakness, evidence of abdominal pain and depression. These signs were reversed with cessation of lead dosing and CaEDTA treatment. Blood lead levels and the number of marrow cells with non-haeme iron increased in both lead-dosed groups; nucleated red blood cells increased only in high lead dosed group. There was a trend for an increased packed cell volume in all groups; however, the high lead dosed group did not increase as fast. No significant changes were observed in blood glutathione concentration and in other haematologic parameters. There were no differences in the parameters studied between the dogs treated with CaEDTA and those not so treated. Blood lead levels and the number of nucleated red blood cells decreased after cessation of lead administration and the number of marrow cells with iron also tended to decrease after lead removal."

Although several previous investigations in humans and experimental animals have demonstrated that nitrous oxide possesses direct negative inotropic effects, this conclusion remains controversial. This investigation reexamined the effect of nitrous oxide on myocardial contractile function when this agent was combined with baseline isoflurane or sufentanil anesthesia in chronically instrumented dogs. Contractility was evaluated with the use of the regional preload recruitable stroke work (PRSW)-end-diastolic segment length relationship, a method that provides an accurate, relatively afterload-independent assessment of inotropic state in conscious and anesthetized dogs. Because autonomic nervous system tone may influence the response of systemic hemodynamics to anesthesia in vivo, experiments were performed in the presence of pharmacologic blockade of the autonomic nervous system. Two groups of experiments, consisting of a total of 15 experiments, were performed with 12 dogs. Dogs, chronically instrumented for measurement of systemic hemodynamics, including left ventricular pressure and subendocardial segment length, were anesthetized with isoflurane or sufentanil. Thirty percent and 70% nitrous oxide were then administered in a random fashion. Left ventricular pressure-segment length loops were generated after 30 min of equilibration after each anesthetic intervention with the use of preload reduction by partial inferior vena caval constriction, and regional PRSW was calculated. Regional PRSW versus end-diastolic length slope reflected decreases in contractile state when nitrous oxide was added to isoflurane (50 +/- 5 for isoflurane alone to 28 +/- 2 erg.cm-2 x 10(-3).min-1 with 70% added nitrous oxide) or sufentanil (73 +/- 8 for sufentanil alone to 52 +/- 5 erg.cm-2 x 10(-3).mm-1 with 70% added nitrous oxide). Similar decreases in left ventricular positive dP/dt50 were observed as well, reflecting decreases in contractile function. The results further suggest that the degree of functional depression produced by nitrous oxide is nearly equal when isoflurane and sufentanil groups are compared. This study demonstrates that nitrous oxide possesses direct negative inotropic actions independent of changes in autonomic nervous system tone in the chronically instrumented dog."

These drugs include phenylalkylamines such as mescaline and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM), and indoleamines such as (+)-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin. Despite their differences in chemical structure, the two classes of hallucinogens produce remarkably similar subjective effects in humans, and induce cross-tolerance. The phenylalkylamine hallucinogens are selective 5-HT(2) receptor agonists, whereas the indoleamines are relatively non-selective for serotonin (5-HT) receptors. There is extensive evidence, from both animal and human studies, that the characteristic effects of hallucinogens are mediated by interactions with the 5-HT(2A) receptor. Nevertheless, there is also evidence that interactions with other receptor sites contribute to the psychopharmacological and behavioral effects of the indoleamine hallucinogens. This article reviews the evidence demonstrating that the effects of indoleamine hallucinogens in a variety of animal behavioral paradigms are mediated by both 5-HT(2) and non-5-HT(2) receptors."

In some instances, the resulting mutation may cause cardiorespiratory distress in the neonatal or adult animals and may necessitate resuscitation. Here we describe the design and testing of a miniature and versatile ventilator that can deliver varying ventilatory support modes, including conventional mechanical ventilation and high-frequency ventilation, to animals as small as the newborn mouse. With a double-piston body chamber design, the device circumvents the problem of air leakage and obviates the need for invasive procedures such as endotracheal intubation, which are particularly important in ventilating small animals. Preliminary tests on newborn mice as early as postnatal day O demonstrated satisfactory restoration of pulmonary ventilation and the prevention of respiratory failure in mutant mice that are prone to respiratory depression. This device may prove useful in the postnatal management of transgenic/knockout mice with genetically inflicted respiratory disorders."

Under these hypoxic conditions, no significant increase of coronary adenosine effluxes was observed in the presence of 300 microM rAICA alone. However, rAICA-induced augmentation of coronary adenosine efflux during hypoxia was revealed in the presence of an adenosine deaminase inhibitor, erythro-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine hydrochloride, indicating that the failure to note the increase in coronary adenosine efflux was due to a rapid deamination of adenosine to inosine. A depression in heart rate during mild and severe hypoxia was significantly exacerbated by rAICA. These effects on heart rate were mediated by adenosine, since they were effectively blocked by 1,3-dipropyl-8-(2-amino-4-chlorophenyl)xanthine, a selective adenosine A1-receptor antagonist. These results suggest that rAICA elevates adenosine efflux during hypoxia."

Each line, containing approximately 7000 animals, was selected for 16 generations either randomly (control), on pupae weight (PWT), on family size (FST) or on an index containing both PWT and FST. The inbreeding trend was 0.9, 0.5, 0.5 and 0.4 % inbreeding per generation in PWT-selected, FST-selected, index-selected, and control line, respectively. The model used to estimate the inbreeding depression included a linear regression on individual inbreeding coefficients, and random additive genetic effects. Using all the performance and pedigree data, estimated inbreeding depressions in the control line were -0.13 (SE = 0.16; #) and -8.50 (SE = 2.66; μg) per 1 % inbreeding for FST and PWT, respectively. Using only performance data of the latest generation in the control line, the estimated inbreeding depressions changed considerably: -0.17 (SE = 0.82) and -37.4 (SE= 11.9) for FST and PWT, respectively. Estimated inbreeding depression for FST in the FST-selected line was - 0.40 (SE = 0.31). Inbreeding depression for PWT in the PWT-selected line was 21.6 (SE = 25.8). This study indicates that estimating inbreeding depression might best be based on the performance data of animals with an equal and sufficiently-large number of ancestral generations known.

Dipping the amputated forelimb of a newt in a solution of 0.4 M cadmium nitrate completely inhibited or retarded regeneration throughout the 65 days of observation. Other effects of cadmium administration included erythema of the limb, an extensive protrusion of the humerus, and in some cases atypical differentiation of regenerates. When zinc chloride was injected (0.04 mg/g of body weight) intraperitoneally into the newt 24 hours prior to limb amputation and cadmium dipping, the deleterious effects of cadmium treatment were prevented and normal regeneration occurred. When zinc chloride was administered 24 hours after amputation and cadmium dipping, it gave no protection against the cadmium. It is suggested that cadmium might inhibit regeneration through the inactivation of zinc metalloenzymes as a result of an exchange of cadmium for zinc. Zinc chloride administered to newts prior to cadmium treatment may prevent the replacement of zinc by cadmium."
