Although PoKoVs have been detected in pigs in Japan, no complete genome data for Japanese PoKoVs are available. In the present study, 24 nearly complete or complete sequences of the PoKoV genome obtained from 10 diarrheic feces and 14 non-diarrheic feces of Japanese pigs were analyzed using a metagenomics approach. Japanese PoKoVs shared 85.2-100% identity with the complete coding nucleotide (nt) sequences and the closest relationship of 85.1-98.3% with PoKoVs from other countries. Twenty of 24 Japanese PoKoVs carried a deletion of 90 nt in the 2B coding region. Phylogenetic tree analyses revealed that PoKoVs were not grouped according to their geographical region of origin and the phylogenetic trees of the L, P1, P2, and P3 genetic regions showed topologies different from each other. Similarity plot analysis using strains from a single farm revealed partially different similarity patterns among strains from identical farm origins, suggesting that recombination events had occurred. These results indicate that various PoKoV strains are prevalent and not restricted geographically on pig farms worldwide and the coexistence of multiple strains leads to recombination events of PoKoVs and contributes to the genetic diversity and evolution of PoKoVs."

Metagenomic sequencing revealed the presence of rotavirus B in feces from diseased piglets while no other pathogens were identified. Clinical disease was reproduced in experimentally infected piglets, yielding the 11 RVB gene segments for strain Buryat15, with an RVB genotype constellation of G12-P[4]-I13-R4-C4-M4-A8-N10-T4-E4-H7. This genotype constellation has also been identified in the United States. While the Buryat15 VP7 protein lacked unique amino acid differences in the predicted neutralizing epitopes compared to the previously published swine RVB G12 strains, this report of RVB in Russian swine increases our epidemiological knowledge on the global prevalence and genetic diversity of RVB."

Antibiotics have been shown to mediate gene transfer by inducing prophages in certain bacterial strains; therefore, one collateral effect could be prophage induction in the gut microbiome at large. Here we used metagenomics to evaluate the effect of two antibiotics in feed (carbadox and ASP250 [chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine, and penicillin]) on swine intestinal phage metagenomes (viromes). We also monitored the bacterial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. ASP250, but not carbadox, caused significant population shifts in both the phage and bacterial communities. Antibiotic resistance genes, such as multidrug resistance efflux pumps, were identified in the viromes, but in-feed antibiotics caused no significant changes in their abundance. The abundance of phage integrase-encoding genes was significantly increased in the viromes of medicated swine over that in the viromes of nonmedicated swine, demonstrating the induction of prophages with antibiotic treatment. Phage-bacterium population dynamics were also examined. We observed a decrease in the relative abundance of Streptococcus bacteria (prey) when Streptococcus phages (predators) were abundant, supporting the ""kill-the-winner"" ecological model of population dynamics in the swine fecal microbiome. The data show that gut ecosystem dynamics are influenced by phages and that prophage induction is a collateral effect of in-feed antibiotics. This study advances our knowledge of the collateral effects of in-feed antibiotics at a time in which the widespread use of ""growth-promoting"" antibiotics in agriculture is under scrutiny. Using comparative metagenomics, we show that prophages are induced by in-feed antibiotics in swine fecal microbiomes and that antibiotic resistance genes were detected in most viromes. This suggests that in-feed antibiotics are contributing to phage-mediated gene transfer, potentially of antibiotic resistance genes, in the swine gut. Additionally, the so-called ""kill-the-winner"" model of phage-bacterium population dynamics has been shown in aquatic ecosystems but met with conflicting evidence in gut ecosystems. The data support the idea that swine fecal Streptococcus bacteria and their phages follow the kill-the-winner model. Understanding the role of phages in gut microbial ecology is an essential component of the antibiotic resistance problem and of developing potential mitigation strategies."

Little is known about the presence of viruses in smallholder farms where pigs are in close contact with humans and wildlife. This study provides insight into viral communities and the prevalence and characteristics of enteric viral co-infections in smallholder pigs in East Africa. Sequence-independent amplification and high-throughput sequencing were applied to the metagenomics analysis of viruses in feces collected from asymptomatic pigs. A total of 47,213 de novo-assembled contigs were constructed and compared with sequences from the GenBank database. Blastx search results revealed that 1039 contigs (>200Â nt) were related to viral sequences in the GenBank database. Of the 1039 contigs, 612 were not assigned to any viral taxa because they had little similarity to known viral genomic or protein sequences, while 427 contigs had a high level of sequence similarity to known viruses and were assigned to viral taxa. The most frequent contigs related to mammalian viruses resembling members of the viral genera Astrovirus, Rotavirus, Bocavirus, Circovirus, and Kobuvirus. Other less abundant contigs were related to members of the genera Sapelovirus, Pasivirus, Posavirus, Teschovirus and Picobirnavirus. This is the first report on the diversity of the fecal virome of pig populations in East Africa. The findings of the present study help to elucidate the etiology of diarrheal diseases in pigs and identify potential zoonotic and emerging viruses in the region. Further investigations are required to compare the incidence of these viruses in healthy and diseased pigs in order to better elucidate their pathogenic role."

In recent years, HCV-related sequences have been found in bats, rodents, horses, and dogs, indicating a widespread distribution of hepaciviruses among animals. By applying unbiased high-throughput sequencing, a novel virus of the genus Hepacivirus was discovered in a bovine serum sample. De novo assembly yielded a nearly full-length genome coding for a polyprotein of 2,779 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the virus represents a novel species within the genus Hepacivirus. Viral RNA screening determined that 1.6% (n = 5) of 320 individual animals and 3.2% (n = 5) of 158 investigated cattle herds in Germany were positive for bovine hepacivirus. Repeated reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses of animals from one dairy herd proved that a substantial percentage of cows were infected, with some of them being viremic for over 6 months. Clinical and postmortem examination revealed no signs of disease, including liver damage. Interestingly, quantitative RT-PCR from different organs and tissues, together with the presence of an miR-122 binding site in the viral genome, strongly suggests a liver tropism for bovine hepacivirus, making this novel virus a promising animal model for HCV infections in humans. Livestock animals act as important sources for emerging pathogens. In particular, their large herd size and the existence of multiple ways of direct and food-borne infection routes emphasize their role as virus reservoirs. Apart from the search for novel viruses, detailed characterization of these pathogens is indispensable in the context of risk analysis. Here, we describe the identification of a novel HCV-like virus in cattle. In addition, determination of the prevalence and of the course of infection in cattle herds provides valuable insights into the biology of this novel virus. The results presented here form a basis for future studies targeting viral pathogenesis of bovine hepaciviruses and their potential to establish zoonotic infections."

Bovine papillomaviruses (BPVs) are divided into at least 21 genotypes (BPV1 to BPV21), Â with most BPV isolates/strains described to date belonging to one of four genera, including Deltapapillomavirus, Xipapillomavirus, Epsilonpapillomavirus and Dyoxipapillomavirus. Here, we describe the identification and genetic characterization of a new BPV type in the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus. A farm in the state of New York, USA, reported chronic cases of vulvovaginitis in Holstein cows in 2016. Biopsies and/or swab samples collected from the vaginal mucosa were subjected to diagnostic investigation. Conventional diagnostic assays yielded negative results, and vaginal swab samples were subjected to viral metagenomic sequencing. Notably, BLAST searches revealed a papillomavirus genome with 7480 bp in length (67% nt sequence identity to BPV16). Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of the L1 gene of the papillomavirus identified here (tentatively named BPV22) revealed that it clusters with members of the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus. Interestingly, the recently identified BPV16, which was detected in fibropapilloma lesions in cattle also clusters within the Dyokappapapillomavirus group. Each virus, however, forms a separate branch in the phylogenetic tree. These results indicate that the putative BPV22 represents the second BPV within the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus."

Although bacteriophages are abundant in rumen environments, little is known about the types of viruses present or their interaction with the rumen microbiome. We undertook random pyrosequencing of virus-enriched metagenomes (viromes) isolated from bovine rumen fluid and analysed the resulting data using comparative metagenomics. A high level of diversity was observed with up to 28,000 different viral genotypes obtained from each environment. The majority (~78%) of sequences did not match any previously described virus. Prophages outnumbered lytic phages approximately 2:1 with the most abundant bacteriophage and prophage types being associated with members of the dominant rumen phyla (Firmicutes and Proteobacteria). Metabolic profiling based on SEED subsystems revealed an enrichment of sequences with putative functional roles in DNA and protein metabolism, but a surprisingly low proportion of sequences assigned to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. We expanded our analysis to include previously described metagenomic data and 14 reference genomes. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) were detected in most of the microbial genomes, suggesting previous interactions between viral and microbial communities."

However, PCV-2 is a ubiquitous virus in the swine population and a majority of pigs infected with PCV-2 do not develop the disease. Different factors such as age, maintenance, the genetics of PCV-2, other pathogens, etc. have been suggested to contribute to the development of PMWS. However, so far no proven connection between any of these factors and the disease development has been found. In this study we explored the possible presence of other so far unknown DNA containing infectious agents in lymph nodes collected from Swedish pigs with confirmed PMWS through random amplification and high-throughput sequencing. Although the vast majority of the amplified genetic sequences belonged to PCV-2, we also found genome sequences of Torque Teno virus (TTV) and of a novel parvovirus. The detection of TTV was expected since like PCV-2, TTV has been found to have high prevalence in pigs around the world. We were able to amplify a longer region of the parvovirus genome, consisting of the entire NP1 and partial VP1/2. By comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequences and phylogenetic studies we propose that this is a novel porcine parvovirus, with genetic relationship to bocaviruses."

This will help to understand how the microbiome influence the susceptibility of secondary agents and development of disease. We have applied viral metagenomics to investigate the virome of lymph nodes from Swedish pigs suffering from the multifactorial disease postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) as well as from healthy pigs. The aim is to increase knowledge of potential viruses, apart from porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), involved in PMWS development as well as to increase knowledge on the virome of healthy individuals. In healthy individuals, a diverse viral flora was seen with several different viruses present simultaneously. The majority of the identified viruses were small linear and circular DNA viruses, such as different circoviruses, anelloviruses and bocaviruses. In the pigs suffering from PMWS, PCV2 sequences were, as expected, detected to a high extent but other viruses were also identified in the background of PCV2. Apart from DNA viruses also RNA viruses were identified, among them were a porcine pestivirus showing high similarity to a recently (in 2015) discovered atypical porcine pestivirus in the US. Majority of the viruses identified in the background of PCV2 in PMWS pigs could also be identified in the healthy pigs. PCV2 sequences were also identified in the healthy pigs but to a much lower extent than in PMWS affected pigs. Although the method used here is not quantitative the very clear difference in amount of PCV2 sequences in PMWS affected pigs and healthy pigs most likely reflect the very strong replication of PCV2 known to be a hallmark of PMWS. Taken together, these findings illustrate that pigs appear to have a considerable viral flora consisting to a large extent of small single-stranded and circular DNA viruses. Future research on these types of viruses will help to better understand the role that these ubiquitous viruses may have on health and disease of pigs. We also demonstrate for the first time, in Europe, the presence of a novel porcine pestivirus."

It is generally believed that the interaction between different infectious agents plays an important role in regard to respiratory diseases. Therefore, we used high-throughput sequencing combined with viral metagenomics to characterise the viral community of tonsil samples from pigs coming from a conventional herd with lesions in the respiratory tract at slaughter. In parallel, samples from specific pathogen-free pigs were also analysed. This study showed a variable co-infection rate in the different pigs. The differences were not seen at the group level but in individual pigs. Some viruses such as adenoviruses and certain picornaviruses could be found in most pigs, while others such as different parvoviruses and anelloviruses were only identified in a few pigs. In addition, the complete coding region of porcine parvovirus 7 was obtained, as were the complete genomes of two teschoviruses. The results from this study will aid in elucidating which viruses are circulating in both healthy pigs and in pigs associated with respiratory illness. This knowledge is needed for future investigations into the role of viral-viral interactions in relation to disease development."

This study reports the metagenomic detection and complete genome characterization of a novel turkey picornavirus from faecal samples collected from eight turkey farms in Hungary. Using RT-PCR, both healthy (two of three) and affected (seven of eight) commercial turkeys with enteric and/or stunting syndrome were shown to be shedding viruses in seven (88â%) of the eight farms. The viral genome sequence (turkey/M176/2011/HUN; GenBank accession no. JQ691613) shows a high degree of amino acid sequence identity (96â%) to the partial P3 genome region of a picornavirus reported recently in turkey and chickens from the USA and probably belongs to the same species. In the P1 and P2 regions, turkey/M176/2011/HUN is related most closely to, but distinct from, the kobuviruses and turdivirus 1. Complete genome analysis revealed the presence of characteristic picornaviral amino acid motifs, a potential type II-like 5' UTR internal ribosome entry site (first identified among avian-origin picornaviruses) and a conserved, 48 nt long 'barbell-like' structure found at the 3' UTR of turkey/M176/2011/HUN and members of the picornavirus genera Avihepatovirus and Kobuvirus. The general presence of turkey picornavirus - a novel picornavirus species - in faecal samples from healthy and affected turkeys in Hungary and in the USA suggests the worldwide occurrence and endemic circulation of this virus in turkey farms. Further studies are needed to investigate the aetiological role and pathogenic potential of this picornavirus in food animals."

The virus was detected at seven of the eight farms examined. The turkey/M176-TuASV/2011/HUN genome (KC465954) was genetically different from the currently known picornaviruses of turkey origin (megriviruses and galliviruses), and showed distant phylogenetic relationship and common genomic features (e.g. uncleaved VP0 and three predicted and unrelated 2A polypeptides) to duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) of the genus Avihepatovirus. The complete genome analysis revealed multiple distinct genome features like the presence of two in-tandem aphthovirus 2A-like sequence repeats with DxExNPG/P 'ribosome-skipping' sites (76â%, 23/30 amino acids identical), with the first aphthovirus 2A-like sequence being located at the end of the VP1 capsid protein (VP1/2A1 'ribosome-skipping' site). The phylogenetic analyses, low sequence identity (33, 32 and 36â% amino acid identity in P1, P2 and P3 regions) to DHAV, and the type II-like internal ribosome entry site suggests that this turkey picornavirus is related to, but distinct from the genus Avihepatovirus and it could be the founding member of a novel Avihepatovirus sister-clade genus. This is the third, taxonomically highly distinct picornavirus clade identified from turkeys exhibiting varied symptoms."

Many affected animals present with a nonsuppurative inflammatory reaction pattern in the brain. While this pattern supports a viral etiology, the causative pathogen remains unknown in a large proportion of cases. Using viral metagenomics, we identified an astrovirus (bovine astrovirus [BoAstV]-CH13) in the brain of a cow with nonsuppurative encephalitis. Additionally, BoAstV RNA was detected with reverse transcription-PCR and in situ hybridization in about one fourth (5/22 animals) of cattle with nonsuppurative encephalitis of unknown etiology. Viral RNA was found primarily in neurons and at the site of pathology. These findings support the notion that BoAstV infection is a common cause of encephalitis in cattle. Phylogenetically, BoAstV-CH13 was closely related to rare astrovirus isolates from encephalitis cases in animals and a human patient. Future research needs to be directed toward the pathogenic mechanisms, epidemiology, and potential cross-species transmission of these neurotropic astroviruses."

An RVB strain was identified in pooled intestinal samples from Alpine caprine kids (between 2 and 3âdays of age) experiencing high (>90â%) morbidity, and the complete caprine RVB genome was characterized. Histology revealed villus atrophy, the samples tested positive for RVB by real-time RT-PCR and metagenomic next-generation sequencing identified only RVB and orf virus. In the VP4 gene segment, the caprine RVB strain had a higher percentage nucleotide identity to the Indian bovine RVB strains than to the Japanese bovine RVB strains, but the VP7, VP6, VP2, NSP1, NSP2 and NSP5 gene segments of the American caprine RVB strain were genetically related to the Japanese bovine RVB strains. The results indicate a lack of RVB sequences to understand reassortment or the evolutionary relationship of RVB strains from cattle and goats."

The timely identification of novel viruses using NGS technologies is also important for us to control emerging infectious diseases caused by novel viruses. In this study, we identified a novel duck coronavirus (CoV), distinct with chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), using RNA-Seq. The novel duck-specific CoV was a potential novel species within the genus Gammacoronavirus, as indicated by sequences of three regions in the viral 1b gene. We also performed a survey of CoVs in domestic fowls in China using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), targeting the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene. A total of 102 CoV positives were identified through the survey. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral N sequences suggested that CoVs in domestic fowls have diverged into several region-specific or host-specific clades or subclades in the world, and IBVs can infect ducks, geese and pigeons, although they mainly circulate in chickens. Moreover, this study provided novel data supporting the notion that some host-specific CoVs other than IBVs circulate in ducks, geese and pigeons, and indicated that the novel duck-specific CoV identified through RNA-Seq in this study is genetically closer to some CoVs circulating in wild water fowls. Taken together, this study shed new insight into the diversity, distribution, evolution and control of avian CoVs."

However, the virome of PEDV infected pigs and its effect on disease severity remains unknown. The advancements of sequencing technology have made it possible to characterize the entire microbiome of different body sites for any host. The objective of this study was to characterize the RNA virome in PEDV-positive pigs using the hypothesis-free metagenomics approach based on next-generation sequencing. Specifically, 217 PEDV-positive swine fecal swab samples collected from diarrheic piglets over 17 US states during 2015-2016 were analyzed. A Kraken algorithm-based bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of up to 9 different RNA genera besides PEDV (Alphacoronavirus genus), including Mamastrovirus (52%, 113/217), Enterovirus (39%, 85/217), Sapelovirus (31%, 67/217), Posavirus (30%, 66/217), Kobuvirus (23%, 49/217), Sapovirus (13%, 28/217), Teschovirus (10%, 22/217), Pasivirus (9%, 20/217), and Deltacoronavirus (3%, 6/217). There were 58 out of 217 piglets (27%) have PEDV infection alone whereas the remaining 159 (73%) shed 2 up to 9 different viruses. These findings demonstrated that PEDV infected diarrheic pigs had an extensive RNA viral flora consisting of four different families: Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, and Coronaviridae."

Diarrhoea is a common disease in yaks, resulting in major economic losses. To investigate the diversity of viral species, we reported the metagenomics-derived virome in a pooled faecal sample of 20 diarrhoeic yaks. The nine viruses found in the pooled diarrhoeic samples, in order of abundance of nucleic acid sequence, were influenza A virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), rotavirus, ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 (bovine hokovirus), astrovirus (AstV), bovine enterovirus, hepatitis E virus, kobuvirus and woodchuck hepatitis virus. Compared with healthy yaks, only AstV had a significantly higher prevalence rate in diarrhoeal samples, indicating a correlation with the clinical symptoms of diarrhoea in yaks. To further investigate the molecular characterization of yak AstV, a near-full genome was obtained from a diarrhoeic sample. It was 6243 bp in length and shared 46.4â66.2 % similarity with other related bovine AstVs from faeces. Phylogenetic analysis of the genome demonstrated that the yak AstV fell within the bovine AstVs cluster, but was located in a unique lineage, suggesting a novel AstV species was identified in yaks. Interestingly, the ORF2 region of yak AstV had closer similarity and genetically relationship with deer AstV strain CcAstV-2 than that of the bovine AstVs. Further analysis showed that one possible interspecies recombination event occurred in ORF2. In summary, this study expanded our understanding of the viral communities of diarrhoeal yaks and identified a novel AstV that was associated with diarrhoea in yaks."

Genome sequences of sixty-six PRRSV strains were obtained using metagenomic sequencing of serum samples collected in the U.S. in 2014 to explore contemporary genetic diversity. Phylogenetic analysis of the genes encoding the envelope proteins identified four to eight distinct lineages with >87% intraclade identity. To explore the effect of the observed genetic diversity on antigenicity, the genome regions encoding either GP2a-GP3-GP4 or GP5-M in strain SD95-21 were replaced with alleles from each of eight distinct PRRSV strains using reverse genetics. The GP2a-GP3-GP4 region from only four of the eight strains yielded viable recombinant virus. When viable, both GP2a-GP3-GP4 and GP5-M variably affected antigenicity. A strain-dependent significant loss in cross reactivity was variably observed by indirect immunofluorescence assays using antisera from pigs vaccinated with commercial modified-live vaccines following replacement of GP2a-GP3-GP4 or GP5-M. Significantly reduced neutralization titers were similarly measured using antisera from naturally PRRSV-exposed pigs. These results illustrate the need to consider genomic regions besides GP5 for PRRSV epidemiology and vaccination."

Phylogenetic analysis placed these viruses into a highly divergent clade of this rapidly growing new viral family. This new clade of viruses, provisionally named porcine stool-associated circular virus 2 and 3 (PoSCV2 and PoSCV3), encodes a stem-loop structure (presumably the origin of DNA replication) in the small intergenic region and a replication initiator protein commonly found in other biological systems that replicate their genomes via the rolling-circle mechanism.

Historically, electron microscopy has been used to identify suspect viruses, with many small, round viruses eluding classification based solely on morphology. National and regional surveys using molecular diagnostics have revealed that suspect viruses continuously circulate in United States poultry, with many viruses appearing concomitantly and in healthy birds. High-throughput nucleic acid pyrosequencing is a powerful diagnostic technology capable of determining the full genomic repertoire present in a complex environmental sample. We utilized the Roche/454 Life Sciences GS-FLX platform to compile an RNA virus metagenome from turkey flocks experiencing enteric disease. This approach yielded numerous sequences homologous to viruses in the BLAST nr protein database, many of which have not been described in turkeys. Our analysis of this turkey gut RNA metagenome focuses in particular on the turkey-origin members of the Picornavirales, the Caliciviridae, and the turkey Picobirnaviruses."

The results indicate a predominance of herpesviruses from the Mardivirus genus, coming from either vaccinal origin or presumably asymptomatic infection. Despite the high sensitivity of the HTS method used herein to detect small circular DNA viruses, we did not detect any papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses, or circoviruses, indicating that these viruses may not be resident of the chicken skin. The results suggest that the turkey herpesvirus is a resident of chicken skin in vaccinated chickens. This study indicates major differences between the skin viromes of chickens and humans. The origin of this difference remains to be further studied in relation with skin physiology, environment, or virus population dynamics."

VP3, NSP3, and NSP4 of bovine RVBs shared low nucleotide sequence identities (63.3-64.9% for VP3, 65.9-68.2% for NSP3, and 52.6-56.2% for NSP4) with those of murine, human, and porcine RVBs, suggesting that bovine RVBs belong to a novel genotype. Furthermore, significantly low amino acid sequence identities were observed for NSP4 (36.1-39.3%) between bovine RVBs and the RVBs of other species. In contrast, hydrophobic plot analysis of NSP4 revealed profiles similar to those of RVBs of other species and rotavirus A (RVA) strains. Phylogenetic analyses of all gene segments revealed that bovine RVB strains formed a cluster that branched distantly from other RVBs.

Since PoAstVs are detected in apparent healthy pigs, the clinical significance of infection is unknown. However, AstVs have recently been associated with a severe neurological disorder in animals, including humans, and zoonotic potential has been suggested. To date, little is known about the epidemiology of PoAstVs among the pig population in Japan. In this report, we present an analysis of nearly complete genomes of 36 PoAstVs detected by a metagenomics approach in the feces of Japanese pigs. Based on a phylogenetic analysis and pairwise sequence comparison, 10, 5, 15, and 6 sequences were classified as PoAstV2, PoAstV3, PoAstV4, and PoAstV5, respectively. Co-infection with two or three strains was found in individual fecal samples from eight pigs. The phylogenetic trees of ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 of PoAstV2 and PoAstV4 showed differences in their topologies. The PoAstV3 and PoAstV5 strains shared high sequence identities within each genotype in all ORFs; however, one PoAstV3 strain and one PoAstV5 strain showed considerable sequence divergence from the other PoAstV3 and PoAstV5 strains, respectively, in ORF2. Recombination analysis using whole genomes revealed evidence of multiple possible intra-genotype recombination events in PoAstV2 and PoAstV4, suggesting that recombination might have contributed to the genetic diversity and played an important role in the evolution of Japanese PoAstVs."

The aim of the present study was to use viral metagenomics to examine a potential viral involvement in this diarrhoea and to describe the intestinal virome with focus on eukaryotic viruses. Samples from the distal jejunum of 50 diarrhoeic and 19 healthy piglets from 10 affected herds were analysed. The viral fraction of the samples was isolated and nucleic acids (RNA and DNA fractions) were subjected to sequence independent amplification. Samples from diarrhoeic piglets from the same herds were pooled whereas samples from healthy piglets were analysed individually. In total, 29 clinical samples, plus two negative controls and one positive control consisting of a mock metagenome were sequenced using the Ion Torrent platform. The resulting sequence data was subjected to taxonomic classification using Kraken, Diamond and HMMER. In the healthy specimens, eight different mammalian virus families were detected (Adenoviridae, Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae) compared to four in the pooled diarrhoeic samples (Anelloviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae). It was not possible to associate a particular virus family with the investigated diarrhoea. In conclusion, this study does not support the hypothesis that the investigated diarrhoea was caused by known mammalian viruses. The results do, however, indicate that known mammalian viruses were present in the intestine as early as 24-48 hours after birth, indicating immediate infection post-partum or possibly transplacental infection."

The major etiologic agent, however, is unknown. Using metagenomics, we compared the diversity of viruses present in proventriculus samples from flocks diagnosed with TVP to those of healthy flocks in South Korea between 2003 and 2012. Each sample had a mean of 21,538,726 sequence reads generated by high-throughput sequencing, with a mean length of 160 nt. Enrichment in viral sequences suggested that at least three viruses were present in each TVP sample. Although we could not determine a pathogen of TVP that matched the known morphology, picornavirus sequences were present in all five disease samples, suggesting an association with TVP. The five samples yielded 1,045-1,720 bp contigs with 81-84 % nt sequence identity to turkey hepatitis virus (accession number: HM751199). Whole-genome analysis indicated that the QIA01 strain of the novel picornavirus was similar to turkey hepatitis virus in the P2 and P3 regions (82.7 % nt and 95.5 % aa sequence identity), but different in the structural region and partial 2A peptides (56.2 % nt and 23.9 % aa sequence identity). In addition, the QIA01 virus was similar (87.0 % nt and 95.6 % aa sequence identity) to chicken megrivirus, recently detected in chickens with malabsorption syndrome in Hungary. Our results are useful for understanding the genetic diversity of avian picornaviruses and for classifying chicken megrivirus as a pathogen affecting the digestive tract of chickens."

SaVs are highly diverse and are divided into multiple genogroups based on structural protein (VP1) sequences. SaVs detected from pigs belong to eight genogroups (GIII, GV, GVI, GVII, GVIII, GIX, GX, and GXI), but little is known about the SaV genogroup distribution in the Japanese pig population. In the present study, 26 nearly complete genome (>6000 nucleotide: nt) and three partial sequences (2429nt, 4364nt, and 4419nt in length, including the entire VP1 coding region) of SaV were obtained from one diarrheic and 15 non-diarrheic porcine feces in Japan via a metagenomics approach. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete VP1 amino acid sequence (aa) revealed that 29 porcine SaVs were classified into seven genogroups; GIII (11 strains), GV (1 strain), GVI (3 strains), GVII (6 strains), GVIII (1 strain), GX (3 strains), and GXI (4 strains). This manuscript presents the first nearly complete genome sequences of GX and GXI, and demonstrates novel intergenogroup recombination events."

Here, we sequenced the genomes of two porcine SaVs (with strain names of p38 and SH1703) using the metagenomic analyses and traditional RT-PCR methods. Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the complete genome, the full-length VP 1 nucleotide and amino acid sequences to group those two strains. The two porcine SaV strains, p38 and SH1703, detected in this study, were classified as genogroup III and genogroup VII, respectively. These two strains showed similar genomic organization with that of other SaVs. We firstly divided SaVs into 51 genotypes within 19 genogroups.

Viral RNA was restricted to the nervous system and detected in the cytoplasm of affected neurons within the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebellum. Microscopically, the lesions were of widespread neuronal necrosis, microgliosis, and perivascular cuffing preferentially distributed in gray matter and most severe in the cerebellum and brainstem, with increasing intensity caudally down the spinal cord. These results suggest that infection with BoAstV-NeuroS1 is a potential cause of neurologic disease in cattle."

Bayesian and maximum-likelihood analyses of genome sequences showed a close relationship of porcine bufaviruses to human and monkey bufaviruses. Molecular dating of the most recent common ancestors supported a recent introduction of bufaviruses into human and pig populations, respectively. A real-time PCR method was developed to screen 60 faecal samples for the porcine bufavirus DNA, and eight positive samples were found in two neighbouring farms, suggesting a relatively low prevalence (13.3â%). No direct transmission of porcine bufaviruses between two neighbouring farms was found, suggesting that bufaviruses may have spread widely in different geographical regions."

This has resulted in increased contact between humans and pigs. Pigs can act as reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases. Therefore identification of potential zoonotic pathogens is important for public health surveillance. In this study, during a routine general surveillance for African swine fever, domestic pigs from Uganda were screened for the presence of RNA and DNA viruses using a high-throughput pyrosequencing method. Serum samples from 16 domestic pigs were collected from five regions in Uganda and pooled accordingly. Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted and sequenced on the 454 GS-FLX platform. Among the sequences assigned to a taxon, 53% mapped to the domestic pig (Sus scrofa). African swine fever virus, Torque teno viruses (TTVs), and porcine endogenous retroviruses were identified. Interestingly, two pools (B and C) of RNA origin had sequences that showed 98% sequence identity to Ndumu virus (NDUV). None of the reads had identity to the class Insecta indicating that these sequences were unlikely to result from contamination with mosquito nucleic acids. This is the first report of the domestic pig as a vertebrate host for Ndumu virus. NDUV had been previously isolated only from culicine mosquitoes. NDUV therefore represents a potential zoonotic pathogen, particularly given the increasing risk of human-livestock-mosquito contact."

Here, we report the identification of a novel bovine group A rotavirus from diarrhea of adult cows. A group A rotavirus was detected from an epizootic outbreak of diarrhea in adult cows with a decrease in milk production in Japan in 2013. The comprehensive genomic analyses from fecal samples by viral metagenomics using a next-generation sequencer revealed that it had an unreported genotype combination G15P[14].

Here, we conducted a molecular epidemiological survey for the influenza D virus in healthy and respiratory-diseased cattle in Japan. We found that 2.1% (8/377) of the cattle were infected with influenza D. The cattle with and without respiratory symptoms had approximately equal amounts of the virus. A full-genome sequence analysis revealed that the influenza D virus that was isolated in Japan formed an individual cluster that was distinct from the strains found in other countries. These results suggest that this virus might have evolved uniquely in Japan over a long period of time and that the viral pathology of Japanese strains might be different from the strains found in other countries.

Twenty-one viruses were detected, with bovine rhinitis A (52.7â%) and B (23.7â%) virus, and bovine coronavirus (24.7â%) being the most commonly identified.

The detection of IDV was further confirmed using a real-time PCR assay. Nasal swabs from symptomatic animals had significantly more IDV RNA than those collected from healthy animals (P=0.04). In addition to known viruses, new genotypes of bovine rhinitis B virus and enterovirus E were identified and a newly proposed species of bocaparvovirus, Ungulate bocaparvovirus 6, was characterized. Ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 was also detected for the first time in North America to our knowledge.

Nine of the 15 Japanese BoAstVs were closely related to Chinese BoAstVs and clustered into a lineage (tentatively named lineage 1) in all phylogenetic trees. Three of 15 strains were phylogenetically separate from lineage 1, showing low sequence identities, and clustered instead with an American strain isolated from cattle with respiratory disease (tentatively named lineage 2).

This virus, named porcine picornavirus Japan (PPVJ), had a standard picornavirus genome organization, including the L protein region. The 5' untranslated region harbored a type II internal ribosomal entry site. This virus was most closely related to lesavirus 1 (amino acid sequence identity: 38.2Â %) in P1, equine rhinitis A virus (25.8Â %) in P2, and lesavirus 2 (40.9Â %) in P3. According to the genus demarcations for the family Picornaviridae (less than 40Â %, 40Â %, and 50Â % amino acid sequence identity in P1, P2, and P3, respectively), PPVJ represents a new genus in the family Picornaviridae. PPVJ was detected in 23.3Â % of the fecal samples (from 58.3Â % of the farms across a wide area) from pigs less than four months old, by reverse transcription PCR, using specific primers designed from the 3D sequence, followed by sequencing. The host range and pathogenic potential of this virus in animals is yet to be determined."

In order to identify viruses associated with BRD, we used a metagenomics approach to enrich and sequence viral nucleic acids in the nasal swabs of 50 young dairy cattle with symptoms of BRD. Following deep sequencing, de novo assembly, and translated protein sequence similarity searches, numerous known and previously uncharacterized viruses were identified. Bovine adenovirus 3, bovine adeno-associated virus, bovine influenza D virus, bovine parvovirus 2, bovine herpesvirus 6, bovine rhinitis A virus, and multiple genotypes of bovine rhinitis B virus were identified. The genomes of a previously uncharacterized astrovirus and picobirnaviruses were also partially or fully sequenced. Using real-time PCR, the rates of detection of the eight viruses that generated the most reads were compared for the nasal secretions of 50 animals with BRD versus 50 location-matched healthy control animals. Viruses were detected in 68% of BRD-affected animals versus 16% of healthy control animals. Thirty-eight percent of sick animals versus 8% of controls were infected with multiple respiratory viruses. Significantly associated with BRD were bovine adenovirus 3 (P < 0.0001), bovine rhinitis A virus (P = 0.005), and the recently described bovine influenza D virus (P = 0.006), which were detected either alone or in combination in 62% of animals with BRD. A metagenomics and real-time PCR detection approach in carefully matched cases and controls can provide a rapid means to identify viruses associated with a complex disease, paving the way for further confirmatory tests and ultimately to effective intervention strategies. Bovine respiratory disease is the most economically important disease affecting the cattle industry, whose complex root causes include environmental, genetics, and infectious factors. Using an unbiased metagenomics approach, we characterized the viruses in respiratory secretions from BRD cases and identified known and previously uncharacterized viruses belonging to seven viral families. Using a case-control format with location-matched animals, we compared the rates of viral detection and identified 3 viruses associated with severe BRD signs. Combining a metagenomics and case-control format can provide candidate pathogens associated with complex infectious diseases and inform further studies aimed at reducing their impact."

PCV2, which has previously been associated with these clinical presentations, was not identified. High levels of PCV3 nucleic acid were observed in aborted fetuses by quantitative PCR, and PCV3 antigen was localized in histologic lesions typical of PDNS in sows by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis.

Only little is known about factors influencing its general composition. Here, the effect of the probiotic bacterium Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) NCIMB 10415 on the pig faecal virome composition was analysed in a pig feeding trial with sows and their piglets, which received either the probiotic bacterium or not. From 8 pooled faecal samples derived from the feeding trial, DNA and RNA virus particles were prepared and subjected to process-controlled Next Generation Sequencing resulting in 390,650 sequence reads. In average, 14% of the reads showed significant sequence identities to known viruses. The percentage of detected mammalian virus sequences was highest (55-77%) in the samples of the youngest piglets and lowest (8-10%) in the samples of the sows. In contrast, the percentage of bacteriophage sequences increased from 22-44% in the youngest piglets to approximately 90% in the sows. The dominating mammalian viruses differed remarkably among 12 day-old piglets (kobuvirus), 54 day-old piglets (boca-, dependo- and pig stool-associated small circular DNA virus [PigSCV]) and the sows (PigSCV, circovirus and ""circovirus-like"" viruses CB-A and RW-A). In addition, the Shannon index, which reflects the diversity of sequences present in a sample, was generally higher for the sows as compared to the piglets. No consistent differences in the virome composition could be identified between the viromes of the probiotic bacterium-treated group and the control group. The analysis indicates that the pig faecal virome shows a high variability and that its general composition is mainly dependent on the age of the pigs. Changes caused by feeding with the probiotic bacterium E. faecium could not be demonstrated using the applied metagenomics method."

PPV6, the most recently described porcine parvovirus, was first identified in China in late 2014 in aborted pig fetuses. Prevalence of PPV6 in China was found to be similar in finishing age pigs from farms with and without evidence of swine reproductive failure. Porcine parvovirus 6 (PPV6) was detected by sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and confirmed by overlapping and real-time PCR in the serum of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSv) positive samples. Seven nearly complete genomes of PPV6 were identified in PRRSv genotype 2 positive serum samples submitted to state veterinary diagnostic laboratories in 2014. Further testing using overlapping and real-time PCR determined PPV6 to be present in 13.2Â % of the serums tested. Additionally, PPV6 was present in samples from all of the geographic locations sampled encompassing nine states in the United States and one state in Mexico. The presence of PPV6 in serum indicates that the PPV6 infection is disseminated and not localized to a specific tissue type. Alignments of the near full length genomes, NS1, and capsid genes identified one of the five PPV6 isolates from China (98.6-99.5Â % identity with the North American strains) to be the North American strains nearest relative. These results are the first to report the presence of PPV6 in North America and demonstrate that the virus is found in multiple geographic areas in the United States and in Mexico. The overall prevalence of PPV6 in PRRSv viremic animals is relatively low. Further, all of the PPV6 genomes found in North America are most closely related to a PPV6 strain first identified in 2014 in healthy pigs from the Tianjin province of China."

In many cases, the causative agent cannot be identified, because the pathogens are unknown or detection methods are not routinely available. In our case, a 15-month-old cow developed central nervous disorders and died within 6 days after the onset of clinical signs. The histopathology revealed an acute encephalitis, predominantly in the brain stem, and a ganglionitis of the trigeminal ganglion with massive neuronal necroses in both the brain and the ganglion. However, a relevant panel of bacterial and viral infections of cattle could be routinely excluded. Therefore, a brain sample from the cow was analysed using a metagenomics approach with next-generation sequencing. A novel bovine astrovirus (BoAstV-BH89/14) could be identified using the analysis pipeline RIEMS, and the finding could be confirmed with a specific BoAstV RT-qPCR. The genome of the bovine astrovirus (BoAstV), belonging to the family Astroviridae in the genus Mamastrovirus, has a length of 6478 bp. Sequence identities between 71% to a sheep astrovirus and 69% to two recently described bovine astroviruses from the USA and Switzerland were ascertained. The latter were also connected to encephalitis cases in cattle. Like these, the new virus described here was detected in different brain sections using the specific BoAstV RT-qPCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization. In conclusion, while astroviruses so far were mainly found in relation to gastroenteritis in animals and humans, recently detected astrovirus infections were also related to encephalitis."

Porcine RNA viruses identified, in order of decreasing number of sequence reads, consisted of kobuviruses, astroviruses, enteroviruses, sapoviruses, sapeloviruses, coronaviruses, bocaviruses, and teschoviruses. The near-full genomes of multiple novel species of porcine astroviruses and bocaviruses were generated and phylogenetically analyzed. Multiple small circular DNA genomes encoding replicase proteins plus two highly divergent members of the Picornavirales order were also characterized. The possible origin of these viral genomes from pig-infecting protozoans and nematodes, based on closest sequence similarities, is discussed. In summary, an unbiased survey of viruses in the feces of intensely farmed animals revealed frequent coinfections with a highly diverse set of viruses providing favorable conditions for viral recombination. Viral surveys of animals can readily document the circulation of known and new viruses, facilitating the detection of emerging viruses and prospective evaluation of their pathogenic and zoonotic potentials."

CRESS DNA viruses are present in the virome of many ecosystems and are known to infect a wide range of organisms. A large number of the recently identified CRESS DNA viruses cannot be classified into any known viral families, indicating that the current view of CRESS DNA viral sequence space is greatly underestimated. Animal faecal matter has proven to be a particularly useful source for sampling CRESS DNA viruses in an ecosystem, as it is cost-effective and non-invasive. In this study a viral metagenomic approach was used to explore the diversity of CRESS DNA viruses present in the faeces of domesticated and wild animals in New Zealand. Thirty-eight complete CRESS DNA viral genomes and two circular molecules (that may be defective molecules or single components of multicomponent genomes) were identified from forty-nine individual animal faecal samples. Based on shared genome organisations and sequence similarities, eighteen of the isolates were classified as gemycircularviruses and twelve isolates were classified as smacoviruses. The remaining eight isolates lack significant sequence similarity with any members of known CRESS DNA virus groups. This research adds significantly to our knowledge of CRESS DNA viral diversity in New Zealand, emphasising the prevalence of CRESS DNA viruses in nature, and reinforcing the suggestion that a large proportion of CRESS DNA viruses are yet to be identified."

In the present study, the fecal virome of a non-diarrheic Belgian piglet was determined. Although the virome of only a single piglet was analyzed, some interesting data were obtained, including the second complete genome of a pig group C rotavirus (RVC). This Belgian strain was only distantly related to the only other completely characterized pig RVC strain, Cowden. Its relatedness to RVC strains from other host species was also analyzed and the porcine strain found in our study was only distantly related to RVCs detected in humans and cows. The gene encoding the outer capsid protein VP7 belonged to the rare porcine G3 genotype, which might be serologically distinct from most other pig RVC strains. A putative novel RVC VP6 genotype was identified as well. A group A rotavirus strain also present in this fecal sample contained the rare pig genotype combination G11P[27], but was only partially characterized. Typical pig RVA genotypes I5, A8, and T7 were found for the viral proteins VP6, NSP1, and NSP3, respectively. Interestingly, the fecal virome of the piglet also contained an astrovirus and an enterovirus, of which the complete genomes were characterized. Results of the current study indicate that many viruses may be present simultaneously in fecal samples of non-diarrheic piglets. In this study, these viruses could not be directly associated with any disease, but still they might have had a potential subclinical impact on pig growth performance. The fast evolution of NGS will be a powerful tool for future diagnostics in veterinary practice. Its application will certainly lead to better insights into the relevance of many (sub)clinical enteric viral infections, that may have remained unnoticed using traditional diagnostic techniques. This will stimulate the development of new and durable prophylactic measures to improve pig health and production."

The capacities of nanopore sequencing for viral diagnostics were investigated here. First, cell culture-grown porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and rotavirus A were pooled and sequenced on a MinION. Reads were already detected at 7âseconds after start of sequencing, resulting in high sequencing depths (19.2 to 103.5X) after 3âh. Next, diarrheic feces of a one-week-old piglet was analyzed. Almost all reads (99%) belonged to bacteriophages, which may have reshaped the pigletâs microbiome. Contigs matched <jats:italic>Bacteroides</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Escherichia</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Enterococcus</jats:italic> phages. Moreover, porcine kobuvirus was discovered in the feces for the first time in Belgium.

MinION enables rapid detection of enteric viruses. Such new methodologies will change diagnostics, but more extensive validations should be conducted. The true enteric pathogenicity of porcine kobuvirus should be questioned, while its subclinical importance cannot be excluded.</jats:p>"

Here, we report the discovery and genetic characterization of a novel virus present in cattle with respiratory disease. Phylogenetic characterization of this virus revealed that it clusters within the subfamily Torovirinae, in the family Coronaviridae. The complete genome consists of only 20,261 nt and represents the smallest reported coronavirus genome. We identified seven ORFs, including the canonical nidovirus ORF1a and ORF1b. Analysis of polyprotein 1ab revealed that this virus, tentatively named bovine nidovirus (BoNV), shares the highest homology with the recently described python-borne nidoviruses and contains several conserved nidovirus motifs, but does not encode the NendoU or O-MT domains that are present in other viruses within the family Coronaviridae. In concert with its reduced genome, the atypical domain architecture indicates that this virus represents a unique lineage within the order Nidovirales."

Fifty-nine EV-G sequences, which were >5,000 nucleotides long, were obtained. By complete VP1 sequence analysis, Japanese EV-G isolates were classified into G1 (17 strains), G2 (four strains), G3 (22 strains), G4 (two strains), G6 (two strains), G9 (six strains), G10 (five strains), and a new genotype (one strain). Remarkably, 16 G1 and one G2 strain identified in diarrheic (23.5%; four strains) or normal (76.5%; 13 strains) fecal samples possessed a papain-like cysteine protease (PL-CP) sequence, which was recently found in the USA and Belgium in the EV-G genome, at the 2C-3A junction site. This paper presents the first report of the high prevalence of viruses carrying PL-CP in the EV-G population. Furthermore, possible inter- and intragenotype recombination events were found among EV-G strains, including G1-PL-CP strains. Our findings may advance the understanding of the molecular epidemiology and genetic evolution of EV-Gs."

Live poultry markets were suspected locations of the human H7N9 infection sources, based on the cases' exposure histories and sequence similarities between viral isolates. To explore the role of live poultry markets in the origin of the novel H7N9 virus, we systematically examined poultry and environmental specimens from local markets and farms in Hangzhou, using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) as well as high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS). RT-PCR identified specimens positive for the H7 and N9 genomic segments in all of the 12 poultry markets epidemiologically linked to 10 human H7N9 cases. Chickens, ducks, and environmental specimens from the markets contained heavily mixed subtypes, including H7, N9, H9, and N2 and sometimes H5 and N1. The idea of the coexistence of H7N9 and H9N2 subtypes in chickens was further supported by metagenomic sequencing. In contrast, human H7N9 infection cases (n = 31) were all negative for H9N2 virus according to real-time RT-PCR. The six internal segments were indistinguishable for the H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H9, N2, and internal-segment sequences were very close to the sequence of the H9N2 virus circulating in chickens in China recently. Our results provide direct evidence that H9N2 strains coexisted with the novel human-pathogenic H7N9 influenza virus in epidemiologically linked live poultry markets. Avian influenza A virus of the H9N2 subtype likely made a recent contribution to the evolution of the H7N9 virus and continues to do so. Our results suggest that avian influenza A virus of the H9N2 subtype likely made a recent contribution to the evolution of the H7N9 virus, a novel reassortant avian influenza virus A subtype, and continues to do so. The finding helps shed light on how the H7N9 virus emerged, spread, and transmitted to humans. It is of considerable interest for assessing the risk of the possible emergence of novel reassortant viruses with enhanced transmissibility to humans."

The prevalence rate of each virus was verified from diarrhoeic and healthy piglets by PCR assay. A mean of 5.5 different viruses were shed in diarrhoeic piglets, and one piglet was in fact co-infected with 11 different viruses. By contrast, healthy piglets shed a mean of 3.2 different viruses. Compared with samples from healthy piglets, the co-infection of PEDV and PBoV had a high prevalence rate in diarrhoea samples, suggesting a correlation with the appearance of diarrhoea in piglets.

We developed and applied a procedure for high-throughput RNA sequencing of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) from cell culture-derived isolates and clinical specimens. Ten PRRSV isolates with known sequence information, 2 mixtures each with 2 different PRRSV isolates, and 51 clinical specimens (19 sera, 16 lungs, and 16 oral fluids) with various PCR threshold cycle (Ct) values were subjected to nucleic acid extraction, cDNA library preparation (24-plexed), and sequencing.

The percentage values of RNA virus reads, compared to the total animal virus reads in each of the four strains were 96.96% (A), 97.30% (B), 98.01 (C), and 67.49% (D), and were mainly from Orthomyxoviridae, Mimiviridae, Bunyaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Reoviridae. Meanwhile, the minority of DNA virus reads were related to Herpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Iridoviridae, and other, low abundance viral families. The percentage values of Orthomyxoviridae, Mimiviridae, Bunyaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Herpesviridae reads were not significantly different among strains A, B, and C; however, there were marked differences in the abundance of these reads in strain D.

Therefore, many different antigenic forms, serotypes, or variant strains of avian coronaviruses (AvCoV) exist worldwide. Only a few of them, the so called protectotypes, cross protect against different serotypes. New serotypes arise by recombination or spontaneous mutations. From time to time, antigenic virus variants appear which differ significantly from known serotypes. The result of this variability is an inconsistent nomenclature and classification of virus strains.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed their clustering into two variant groups. Group I consisted of one variant (VSVRI_F3), which had 99.1% nucleotide sequence identity to the Q1 reference strain. Group II consisted of variants VSVRI_G4 and VSVRI_G9, which showed 92.8%-94.3% nucleotide identity with the Egyptian variants Eg/12120S/2012, Eg/12197B/2012, and Eg/1265B/2012. Regarding the deduced amino acid sequence, the three variants had 77.1%-85.2% similarity with the vaccine strains currently used in Egypt. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring the prevalence of IBV variants in vaccinated broiler flocks as well as adopting an appropriate vaccination strategy."

A QX-like strain was analysed by high-throughput Illumina sequencing and genetic variation across the entire viral genome was explored at the sub-consensus level by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. Thirteen open reading frames (ORFs) in the order 5'-UTR-1a-1ab-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3'UTR were predicted. The relative frequencies of missense: silent SNPs were calculated to obtain a comparative measure of variability in specific genes. The most variable ORFs in descending order were E, 3b, 5'UTR, N, 1a, S, 1ab, M, 4c, 5a, 6b. The E and 3b protein products play key roles in coronavirus virulence, and RNA folding demonstrated that the mutations in the 5'UTR did not alter the predicted secondary structure. The frequency of SNPs in the Spike (S) protein ORF of 0.67% was below the genomic average of 0.76%. Only three SNPS were identified in the S1 subunit, none of which were located in hypervariable region (HVR) 1 or HVR2. The S2 subunit was considerably more variable containing 87% of the polymorphisms detected across the entire S protein. The S2 subunit also contained a previously unreported multi-A insertion site and a stretch of four consecutive mutated amino acids, which mapped to the stalk region of the spike protein. Template-based protein structure modelling produced the first theoretical model of the IBV spike monomer. Given the lack of diversity observed at the sub-consensus level, the tenet that the HVRs in the S1 subunit are very tolerant of amino acid changes produced by genetic drift is questioned."

To determine the source of the outbreak, we defined the phylogenetic relationships between various H6N2 isolates, and the previously unpublished gene sequences of an H6N8 virus isolated in 1998 from ostriches in the Leeu Gamka region (A/Ostrich/South Africa/KK98/98). We demonstrated that two distinct genetic H6N2 lineages (sub-lineages I and II) circulated in the Camperdown area, which later spread to other regions. Sub-lineages I and II shared a recent common H6N2 ancestor, which arose from a reassortment event between two South African ostrich isolates A/Ostrich/South Africa/9508103/95 and (H9N2) A/Ostrich/South Africa/KK98/98 (H6N8). Furthermore, the H6N2 sub-lineage I viruses had several molecular genetic markers including a 22-amino acid stalk deletion in the neuraminidase (NA) protein gene, a predicted increased N-glycosylation, and a D144 mutation of the HA protein gene, all of which are associated with the adaptation of AI viruses to chickens. The H6N2 NS1 and PB1 genes shared recent common ancestors with those of contemporary Asian HPAI H5N1 viruses. Our results suggest that ostriches are potential mixing vessels for avian influenza viruses (AIV) outbreak strains and support other reports that H6 viruses are capable of forming stable lineages in chickens."

Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) were performed on sera from ostrich farms in the outbreak region, and intravenous pathogenicity (IVPI) tests, reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR), nucleic acid sequencing and phylogenetic comparisons were performed on the HPAI H5N2 virus isolated during the outbreak. The deduced amino acid sequence at the HA0 cleavage site determined by RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing was PQREKRRKKRGLF and thus the virus fell within the definition of a highly pathogenic virus, but in an IVPI test in chickens on the virus isolated from the index case and a value of 0.63 was recorded, which is below the criterion for highly pathogenic viruses in this in vivo test. After a further passage in embryonated eggs a second IVPI was carried out and an elevated value of 1.19 was obtained. Cloacal swabs were taken from the initial IVPI birds, inoculated into embryonated chickens eggs and a third IVPI was then performed on the resulting haemagglutinating, infective allantoic fluid. An index of 2.73 was recorded. HI tests appeared to be the more sensitive test compared to AGID when testing for antibodies to avian influenza in sera. An ostrich-derived virus with a virulent HA0 cleavage site was not initially virulent in chickens but after passage in the latter the virulence increased. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated the link between AI viruses carried by wild ducks and those infecting ostriches."

The detection of many novel porcine parvoviruses has however been on the increase for the past few years, but there is a dearth of information on the occurrence and prevalence of these viruses in South Africa. Molecular detection of some known parvoviruses, namely porcine parvoviruses (PPVs) - 1, 2, 3 and 4, porcine bocavirus-like virus (PBo-likeV) and porcine bocaviruses (PBoV1/2), was carried out from 110 randomly selected archived swine samples collected in the year 2015 and 2016. Samples were drawn from previously screened and confirmed porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infected farms, with farm-level occurrence ranged from 5.6 to 60%. The findings showed that all the screened parvoviruses were present as follows: PPV1 (29.1%), PPV2 (21.8%), PPV3 (5.5%), PPV4 (43.6%), PBo-likeV (21.8%) and PBoV1/2 (44.6%). The frequency of double infections of the viruses was as high as 18.2% of PPV2/PPV4 and PPV4/PBoVs; while 17.3% and 7.3% of the screened samples showed multiple infections of the three and four viruses respectively. Further phylogenetic analyses of partial PPV1, 2 and PBoV1/2 sequences showed two major clades for each of the viruses. This study reports the first epidemiological survey and molecular characterisation of the classical and emerging porcine parvoviruses in South African swine herds. It also gives insights into the diversity and distribution of these viral pathogens within the herds of the study area and confirms their co-infection potentials with PCV2."

Attempts to classify COTV within a recognized genus of the Poxviridae have generated contradictory findings. Studies by different researchers suggested some similarity to myxoma virus and swinepox virus, whereas another investigation characterized COTV SPAn232 as a vaccinia virus strain. Because of the lack of consensus, we have conducted an independent biological and molecular characterization of COTV. Virus growth curves reached maximum yields at approximately 24 to 48 h and were accompanied by virus DNA replication and a characteristic early/late pattern of viral protein synthesis. Interestingly, COTV did not induce detectable cytopathic effects in BSC-40 cells until 4 days postinfection and generated viral plaques only after 8 days. We determined the complete genomic sequence of COTV by using a combination of the next-generation DNA sequencing technologies 454 and Illumina. A unique contiguous sequence of 185,139 bp containing 185 genes, including the 90 genes conserved in all chordopoxviruses, was obtained. COTV has an interesting panel of open reading frames (ORFs) related to the evasion of host defense, including two novel genes encoding C-C chemokine-like proteins, each present in duplicate copies. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the highest amino acid identity scores with Cervidpoxvirus, Capripoxvirus, Suipoxvirus, Leporipoxvirus, and Yatapoxvirus. However, COTV grouped as an independent branch within this clade, which clearly excluded its classification as an Orthopoxvirus. Therefore, our data suggest that COTV could represent a new poxvirus genus."

Descriptive geographical chronology analysis was conducted to present the progressive shift of the outbreaks westwards, and at the same time, the absence of further outbreaks in previously affected regional units where high vaccination coverage was achieved. Isolation and molecular characterization of LSDV from the first recorded case in Greece (Evros/GR/15 isolate) was performed. The two live attenuated LSD vaccine viruses, currently used for emergency immunization in Greece, were sequenced and compared to the Evros/GR/15 isolate, in 3 genomic regions (GPCR gene, RPO30 gene, and partial LSDV126/LSDV127 genes). Sequence comparisons revealed prominent differences between the Evros/GR/15 isolate and the vaccine strains. Phylogenetic analysis resulted in the classification of the Evros/GR/15 isolate in the same clade with all field LSDV isolates, whereas vaccine strains were grouped in a distinct cluster within the LSDV clade. Additional samples from animals presenting skin nodules (N=13) were characterized by sequencing in the 3 aforementioned genomic regions. Among them, in 5 animals that were vaccinated, the attenuated vaccine virus was identified. A PCR-RFLP method targeting the LSDV127 gene was developed and proved to be able to discriminate between the characterized field and vaccine strains. The findings of the present study substantiate the importance of timely and intensive vaccinations for the control of LSDV epizootic and the genetic differences between the Evros/GR/15 isolate and the vaccine strains. This provides the basis for the development of PCR-based DIVA assays, which would be of major importance for effective disease surveillance and stamping-out during LSD vaccination campaigns."

However, the nature of ORFV circulating among sheep and goat in Kashmir Himalayas has not yet been characterized. In the present study, we describe natural outbreaks of ORFV in sheep and goats of Kashmir Himalayas. We detected the presence of ORFV in the scab lesion by PCR amplification of the major envelope protein (B2L) gene. We sequenced the virus interferon resistance (VIR) gene and determined their phylogenetic relationship with that of the published reference sequences. Phylogenetic analysis based on VIR gene revealed that the ORFV isolates from Kashmir Himalayas separated into main two clusters. The sheep isolates showed genetic homology with the sheep strains reported from Greece and Italy, whereas the goat-specific strain show homology with the goat strains reported from China. This study demonstrates the presence of ORFV infection in sheep and goats, and report first phylogenetic analysis of the ORFV strains prevalent in the Kashmir Himalayas."

Although assigning viruses to their hosts is basically important not only for virology but also for prevention of epidemic, it has been a laborious and difficult task to date. The only effective method for this purpose has been to find them in a same microscopic view. Now, we tried a computational approach based on genome sequences of bacteria and phages, introducing a physicochemical parameter, SOSS (set of oligostickiness similarity score) derived from oligostickiness, a measure of binding affinity of oligonucleotides to template DNA. We could confirm host-parasite relationships of bacteria and their phages by SOSS analysis: all phages tested (25 species) had a remarkably higher SOSS value with its host than with unrelated bacteria. Interestingly, according to SOSS values, lysogenic phages such as lambda phage (host: Escherichia coli) or SPP1 (host: Bacillus subtilis) have distinctively higher similarity with its host than its non-lysogenic (excretive or virulent) ones such as fd and T4 (host: E.coli) or phages gamma and PZA (host: B.subtilis). This finding is very promising for assigning host-unknown viruses to its host. We also investigated the relationship in codon usage frequency or G+C content of genomes to interpret the phenomenon revealed by SOSS analysis, obtaining evidences which support the hypothesis that higher SOSS values resulted from the cohabitation in the same environment which may cause the common biased mutation. Thus, lysogenic phages which stay inside longer resemble the host."

Samples that were VI-positive were serotyped by antigen detection ELISA (Ag-ELISA) and VP1 sequence acquisition and analysis. Sequence data identified FMDV serotypes A (nÂ =Â 13), O (nÂ =Â 36) and Asia-1 (nÂ =Â 41), including three samples from which both serotypes Asia-1 and O were detected. Serotype A viruses were classified within three different Iran-05 sublineages: HER-10, FAR-11 and ESF-10. All serotype Asia-1 were within Group VII (Sindh-08 lineage), in a genetic clade that differs from viruses isolated prior to 2010. All serotypes O were classified as PanAsia-2 within two different sublineages: ANT-10 and BAL-09. Using VP1 sequencing as the gold standard for serotype determination, the overall sensitivity of Ag-ELISA to correctly determine serotype was 74%, and serotype-specific sensitivity was 8% for serotype A, 88% for Asia-1 and 89% for O. Serotype-specific specificity was 100% for serotype A, 93% for Asia-1 and 94% for O. Interestingly, 12 of 13 serotype A viruses were not detected by Ag-ELISA.

In the present study, 24 nearly complete or complete sequences of the PoKoV genome obtained from 10 diarrheic feces and 14 non-diarrheic feces of Japanese pigs were analyzed using a metagenomics approach. Japanese PoKoVs shared 85.2-100% identity with the complete coding nucleotide (nt) sequences and the closest relationship of 85.1-98.3% with PoKoVs from other countries. Twenty of 24 Japanese PoKoVs carried a deletion of 90 nt in the 2B coding region. Phylogenetic tree analyses revealed that PoKoVs were not grouped according to their geographical region of origin and the phylogenetic trees of the L, P1, P2, and P3 genetic regions showed topologies different from each other. Similarity plot analysis using strains from a single farm revealed partially different similarity patterns among strains from identical farm origins, suggesting that recombination events had occurred. These results indicate that various PoKoV strains are prevalent and not restricted geographically on pig farms worldwide and the coexistence of multiple strains leads to recombination events of PoKoVs and contributes to the genetic diversity and evolution of PoKoVs."

Merr.) in Nigeria were molecularly characterized. Based on characteristic symptoms in soybean, the two viruses are provisionally designated as Soybean mild mottle virus (SbMMV) and Soybean chlorotic blotch virus (SbCBV). SbCBV has a bipartite genome, whereas SbMMV has only a DNA A component. The DNA A component of SbMMV is 2,768 nucleotides (nt) long and the DNA A and DNA B components of SbCBV are 2,708 and 2,647 nt long, respectively. In pairwise comparisons, the DNA A component of SbMMV and SbCBV showed 62% nt sequence identity, indicating that these two viruses are distinct. Whereas the DNA A of SbMMV contains two virion- and four complementary-sense open reading frames, that of SbCBV lacks the virus-sense AV2, a signature gene present in 'Old World' begomoviruses. A pairwise comparison with the corresponding nucleotide sequence of other begomoviruses in the databases indicated that SbCBV had a maximum of 74% identity with cowpea golden mosaic virus and SbMMV had a maximum of 65% identity with mungbean yellow mosaic India virus and kudzu mosaic virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA A component of SbCBV and SbMMV together with those of other begomoviruses available in the databases showed clustering of the two viruses within the 'legumovirus' clade of the begomovirus phylogenetic tree. In addition, the DNA A and B components of SbCBV from Centrosema pubescens Benth were found to be identical to those from soybean, indicating that leguminous wild species are a potential alternative host for the virus. Since soybean is an introduced crop, the identification of two distinct begomoviruses naturally infecting soybean in Nigeria suggests the occurrence of 'legumoviruses' in plant species indigenous to Africa and underscores their potential threat to sustainable cultivation of soybean on the African continent."

The aim of the authors was to cover the developments in Newcastle disease (ND) research over the last 40 years that they considered significant. During those 40 years there have been several panzootics of this serious disease in poultry and for the last 30 years there has been a continuing panzootic in domestic pigeons, which has spread to wild birds and poultry. The 40-year period began with worldwide outbreaks of severe ND, which served as an important impetus for ND research work. Although early work was concerned with controlling the disease, specifically by improving and developing new vaccines and vaccine regimens, even prior to the 1970s ND virus was seen as a useful laboratory virus for replication and virulence studies. This review covers the historical developments in the following areas: understanding the molecular basis of virulence; epidemiology and relatedness of different ND strains, both antigenically and genetically; the emergence of virulent strains and their relationship with viruses of low virulence; sequencing and understanding the viral genome and genes; the development of rapid molecular-based diagnostic tests; and the phylogeny and molecular taxonomy of ND virus. The authors suggest areas in which future research could or should be undertaken."

Recently, reproducible (from substrate-to-substrate), spatially homogeneous (over large areas) SERS-active substrates have been commercialized and are now available in the marketplace. We have utilized these patterned surfaces to acquire SERS spectral signatures of intact bovine papular stomatitis, pseudocowpox, and Yaba monkey tumor viruses. Salient spectral signature features make it possible to discriminate among these genetically distinct Poxviridae-Chordopoxvirinae virions. In addition, partial least-squares, a multivariate calibration method, has been used to develop personal computer-borne algorithms useful for classification of unknown Parapoxvirus (e.g., bovine papular stomatitis virus and pseudocowpox virus) samples based solely on SERS spectral signatures. To our knowledge, this is the first report detailing application of these commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) SERS-active substrates to identification of intact poxviruses."

Here we investigate the involvement of AI H5N1 in outbreaks of acute respiratory disease that occurred in several commercial chicken farms in Egypt in 2011, and we describe to the pathology caused by the virus in the course of the outbreak. Twenty-one chicken farms with history of acute respiratory symptoms and high mortalities were screened for AI H5N1. Virus identification was based on hemagglutination inhibition test, and PCR detection and sequencing of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes. Virus distribution was determined by immunohistochemical staining of AI antigens in organs of infected birds. Standard H&E staining was performed for histological examination of affected organs. Eighty-one % of the examined birds, representing 100% of the screened farms, were positive for AI H5N1 virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the isolated virus reveals its affiliation to clade 2.2.1. Viral antigens were localized in the endothelial cells of the heart, liver, lungs and skin, where pathological lesions including congestion, hemorrhages, multifocal inflammation and necrosis were concurrently observed. According to the pattern of the viral antigen and lesion distribution in the visceral organs, we suggest cardiovascular and circulatory failures as the probable cause of death during these outbreaks. In conclusion, the present study further confirms the epidemic status of AI H5N1 virus in Egypt and reveals the highly pathogenic nature of the local isolates."

Recently, two new field isolates (Car1 and Car2) of CCMV obtained from cowpea showed distinct phenotypic symptoms when inoculated to cowpea. CCMV-Car1 induced severe mosaic and interveinal chlorosis, while CCMV-Car2 produced mild mottling and leaf rolling. Both isolates produced asymptomatic infection in Nicotiana benthamiana. The complete genome of both isolates was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using specific primers against the CCMV sequences available in the GenBank database, cloned and sequenced. Both nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared between the newly sequenced CCMV isolates and the three previously characterized CCMV strains (T, M1, and R). Phylogenetic analysis of the RNA 1 sequence showed that CCMV-Car1 was in a separate branch from the rest of the CCMV isolates while CCMV-Car2 grouped together with CCMV-R. On the basis of RNA 2 and RNA 3 sequences, two major groupings were obtained. One group included CCMV-Car1 and CCMV-Car2 isolates while the other contained CCMV-T, CCMV-M1, and CCMV-R strains. Recombination programs detected a potential recombination event in the RNA 1 sequence of CCMV-Car2 isolate but not in RNA 2 and RNA 3 sequences. The results showed that both mutations and recombination have played an important role in the genetic diversity of these two new isolates of CCMV."

The current methods, library screening or representational difference analysis (RDA), are very laborious and require selected sample sets. We have developed a simple and reproducible method for discovering viruses in single serum samples that is based on DNase treatment of the serum followed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) of the fragments, and have evaluated its performance on known viruses. Both DNA viruses and RNA viruses at a concentration of approximately 10(6) genome equivalents per ml were reproducibly identified in 50 microl of serum. While evaluating the method, two previously unknown parvoviruses were discovered in the bovine sera used as diluent. The near complete genome sequence of each virus was determined; their classification as two species (provisionally named bovine parvoviruses 2 and 3) was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Both viruses were found to be frequent contaminants of commercial bovine serum. DNase treatment of serum samples may prove to be a very useful tool for virus discovery. The DNase-SISPA method is suitable for screening of a large number of samples and also enables rapid sequence determination of high-titer viruses."

Antibiotics have been shown to mediate gene transfer by inducing prophages in certain bacterial strains; therefore, one collateral effect could be prophage induction in the gut microbiome at large. Here we used metagenomics to evaluate the effect of two antibiotics in feed (carbadox and ASP250 [chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine, and penicillin]) on swine intestinal phage metagenomes (viromes). We also monitored the bacterial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. ASP250, but not carbadox, caused significant population shifts in both the phage and bacterial communities. Antibiotic resistance genes, such as multidrug resistance efflux pumps, were identified in the viromes, but in-feed antibiotics caused no significant changes in their abundance. The abundance of phage integrase-encoding genes was significantly increased in the viromes of medicated swine over that in the viromes of nonmedicated swine, demonstrating the induction of prophages with antibiotic treatment. Phage-bacterium population dynamics were also examined. We observed a decrease in the relative abundance of Streptococcus bacteria (prey) when Streptococcus phages (predators) were abundant, supporting the ""kill-the-winner"" ecological model of population dynamics in the swine fecal microbiome. The data show that gut ecosystem dynamics are influenced by phages and that prophage induction is a collateral effect of in-feed antibiotics. This study advances our knowledge of the collateral effects of in-feed antibiotics at a time in which the widespread use of ""growth-promoting"" antibiotics in agriculture is under scrutiny. Using comparative metagenomics, we show that prophages are induced by in-feed antibiotics in swine fecal microbiomes and that antibiotic resistance genes were detected in most viromes. This suggests that in-feed antibiotics are contributing to phage-mediated gene transfer, potentially of antibiotic resistance genes, in the swine gut. Additionally, the so-called ""kill-the-winner"" model of phage-bacterium population dynamics has been shown in aquatic ecosystems but met with conflicting evidence in gut ecosystems. The data support the idea that swine fecal Streptococcus bacteria and their phages follow the kill-the-winner model. Understanding the role of phages in gut microbial ecology is an essential component of the antibiotic resistance problem and of developing potential mitigation strategies."

Aerosol transmission among herds is a major concern in pig dense regions and filtration of incoming air, in combination with standard biosecurity procedures, has been demonstrated to prevent transmission of PRRSV into susceptible herds. To quantify the impact of air filtration on reducing risk of PRRSV outbreaks, we compared the incidence rate of new PRRSV introductions in 20 filtered and 17 non-filtered control sow herds in a swine dense region of North America during a 7 year study period. Events of novel virus introduction were ascertained by phylogenetic analysis of PRRSV ORF5 gene sequences. Putative new viruses were defined as exogenous (introduced) based on ORF5 nucleotide sequence differences compared to previous farm isolates. The influence of sequence difference cut-off values ranging from 2 to 10% on case definition and relative risk were evaluated. Non-filtered farms incurred about 0.5 outbreaks per year, with a seasonal increase in risk in cooler periods. Baseline risk, prior to filtration, in treatment farms was approximately 0.75 per year, approximately 50% higher than in control farms. Air filtration significantly reduced risk of PRRSV introduction events to 0.06-0.22 outbreaks per year, depending on the cut-off values used to classify a virus isolate as new to the herd. Overall, air filtration led to an approximately 80% reduction in risk of introduction of novel PRRSV, indicating that on large sow farms with good biosecurity in swine-dense regions, approximately four-fifths of PRRSV outbreaks may be attributable to aerosol transmission."

Forty-three hemagglutinin (HA) and 41 neuraminidase (NA) genes of HPAI H5N1 viruses were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses of completely sequenced genes were performed to compare with other viral HA and NA gene sequences available in the public databases. Molecular characterization of the H5N1 viruses revealed two genetically distinct clades, 2.2.2 and 2.3.1, of H5N1 viruses circulating in the area. Amino acid sequence analysis of the HA gene indicated that the virus from 2.2.2 contained the sequence SPQGERRRK-R/G at the cleavage site, while the virus from 2.3.1 contained the sequence SPQRERRRK-R/G. Additionally, a few mutations with amino acid substitutions such as M226I at N-link glycosylation site were identified in two of these isolates. Amino acid sequence of the NA gene showed a 20-amino-acid deletion in the NA stalk region, required for enhanced virulence of influenza viruses and its adaptation from wild birds to domestic chickens. As close contact between humans and birds is unavoidable, there is a need for a thorough understanding of the virus epidemiology, factors affecting the spread of the virus, and molecular characterization such as phylogeny and substitution rates of H5N1 viruses circulating in the region. Two genetically distinct clades were found to be circulating in the country, which could likely result in recombination and emergence of more virulent viral strains. These findings could be helpful for the authorities devising control measures against these viruses."

The virus infects mainly blood mononuclear cells and displays specific tropism for vascular endothelia, reproductive and fetal tissues. Epidemiological studies suggest its impact on reproductive performance, and its presence in various sites in the reproductive tract highlights its potential transmission in transfer-stage embryos. This work describes the biological and genetic characterization of BoHV-4 strains isolated from an in vitro bovine embryo production system. BoHV-4 strains were isolated in 2011 and 2013 from granulosa cells and bovine oocytes from ovary batches collected at a local abattoir, used as ""starting material"" for in vitro production of bovine embryos. Compatible BoHV-4-CPE was observed in the co-culture of granulosa cells and oocytes with MDBK cells. The identity of the isolates was confirmed by PCR assays targeting three ORFs of the viral genome. The phylogenetic analyses of the strains suggest that they were evolutionary unlinked. Therefore it is possible that BoHV-4 ovary infections occurred regularly along the evolution of the virus, at least in Argentina, which can have implications in the systems of in vitro embryo production. Thus, although BoHV-4 does not appear to be a frequent risk factor for in vitro embryo production, data are still limited. This study reveals the potential of BoHV-4 transmission via embryo transfer. Moreover, the high variability among the BoHV-4 strains isolated from aborted cows in Argentina highlights the importance of further research on the role of this virus as an agent with the potential to cause reproductive disease in cattle. The genetic characterization of the isolated strains provides data to better understand the pathogenesis of BoHV-4 infections. Furthermore, it will lead to fundamental insights into the molecular aspects of the virus and the means by which these strains circulate in the herds."

These viruses are well-recognized for their ability to change tissue tropism, to hurdle the interspecies barriers and to adapt ecological variations. It is predicted that the inherent genetic diversity of CoVs caused by accumulation of point mutations and high frequency of homologous recombination is the principal determinant of these competences. Several CoVs (e.g. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV) have been recorded to cross the interspecies barrier, inducing different disease conditions in variable animal hosts. Bovine CoV (BCoV) is a primary cause of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease in cattle calves, winter dysentery in lactating cows and shipping fever pneumonia in feedlot cattle. Although it has long been known as a restrictive cattle pathogen, CoVs that are closely related to BCoV have been recognized in dogs, humans and in other ruminant species. Biologic, antigenic and genetic analyses of the so-called 'bovine-like CoVs' proposed classification of these viruses as host-range variants rather than distinct virus species. In this review, the different bovine-like CoVs that have been identified in domesticated ruminants (water buffalo, sheep, goat, dromedary camel, llama and alpaca) and wild ruminants (deer, wild cattle, antelopes, giraffes and wild goats) are discussed in terms of epidemiology, transmission and virus characteristics. The presented data denote the importance of these viruses in the persistence of BCoV in nature, spread to new geographical zones, and continuous emergence of disease epidemics in cattle farms."

Little is known about the presence of viruses in smallholder farms where pigs are in close contact with humans and wildlife. This study provides insight into viral communities and the prevalence and characteristics of enteric viral co-infections in smallholder pigs in East Africa. Sequence-independent amplification and high-throughput sequencing were applied to the metagenomics analysis of viruses in feces collected from asymptomatic pigs. A total of 47,213 de novo-assembled contigs were constructed and compared with sequences from the GenBank database. Blastx search results revealed that 1039 contigs (>200Â nt) were related to viral sequences in the GenBank database. Of the 1039 contigs, 612 were not assigned to any viral taxa because they had little similarity to known viral genomic or protein sequences, while 427 contigs had a high level of sequence similarity to known viruses and were assigned to viral taxa. The most frequent contigs related to mammalian viruses resembling members of the viral genera Astrovirus, Rotavirus, Bocavirus, Circovirus, and Kobuvirus. Other less abundant contigs were related to members of the genera Sapelovirus, Pasivirus, Posavirus, Teschovirus and Picobirnavirus. This is the first report on the diversity of the fecal virome of pig populations in East Africa. The findings of the present study help to elucidate the etiology of diarrheal diseases in pigs and identify potential zoonotic and emerging viruses in the region. Further investigations are required to compare the incidence of these viruses in healthy and diseased pigs in order to better elucidate their pathogenic role."

We analysed viral nucleotide sequences from mosquitoes collected in 2005, 2006, and 2007 from a known transmission 'hot spot' in suburban Chicago, USA. Within this approximately 11 x 14 km area, the viral envelope gene has increased approximately 0.1% yr(-1) in nucleotide-level genetic diversity. In each year, viral diversity was higher in 'residential' sites characterized by dense housing than in more open 'urban green space' sites such as cemeteries and parks. Phylodynamic analyses showed an increase in incidence around 2005, consistent with a higher-than-average peak in mosquito and human infection rates that year. Analyses of times to most recent common ancestor suggest that WNV in 2005 and 2006 may have arisen predominantly from viruses present during 2004 and 2005, respectively, but that WNV in 2007 had an older common ancestor, perhaps indicating a predominantly mixed or exogenous origin.

A collection of 44 EHDV isolated from 2008 to 2012 was fully sequenced and analysed phylogenetically. Serotype 2 viruses were the dominant serotype all years except 2012 when serotype 6 viruses represented 63 % of the isolates. High genetic similarity (>94 % identity) between serotype 1 and 2 virus VP1, VP3, VP4, VP6, NS1, NS2 and NS3 segments prevented identification of reassortment events for these segments. Additionally, there was little genetic diversity (>96 % identity) within serotypes for VP2, VP5 and VP7. Preferential reassortment within the homologous serotype was observed for VP2, VP5 and VP7 segments for type 1 and type 2 viruses. In contrast, type 6 viruses were all reassortants containing VP2 and VP5 derived from an exotic type 6 with the remaining segments most similar to type 2 viruses. These results suggest that reassortment between type 1 and type 2 viruses requires conservation of the VP2, VP5 and VP7 segment constellation while type 6 viruses only require VP2 and VP5 and are restricted to type 2-lineage VP7. As type 6 VP2 and VP5 segments were exclusively identified in viruses with type 2-derived VP7, these results suggest functional complementation between type 2 and type 6 VP7 proteins."

Although genome-enabled advancements are providing access to the vast diversity of uncultivated microbes, our understanding of variables shaping rumen microbial communities is in its infancy. Viruses have been shown to impact microbial populations through a myriad of processes, including cell lysis and reprogramming of host metabolism. However, little is known about the processes shaping the distribution of rumen viruses or how viruses may modulate microbial-driven processes in the rumen. To this end, we investigated how rumen bacterial and viral community structure and function responded in five steers fed four randomized dietary treatments in a crossover design. Total digestible nutrients (TDN), a measure of dietary energy, best explained the variation in bacterial and viral communities. Additional ecological drivers of viral communities included dietary zinc content and microbial functional diversity. Using partial least squares regression, we demonstrate significant associations between the abundances of 267 viral populations and variables driving the variation in rumen viral communities. While rumen viruses were dynamic, 14 near ubiquitous viral populations were identified, suggesting the presence of a core rumen virome largely comprised of novel viruses. Moreover, analysis of virally encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) indicates rumen viruses have glycosidic hydrolases to potentially augment the breakdown of complex carbohydrates to increase energy production. Other AMGs identified have a role in redirecting carbon to the pentose phosphate pathway and one carbon pools by folate to boost viral replication. We demonstrate that rumen bacteria and viruses have differing responses and ecological drivers to dietary perturbation. Our results show that rumen viruses have implications for understanding the structuring of the previously identified core rumen microbiota and impacting microbial metabolism through a vast array of AMGs. AMGs in the rumen appear to have consequences for microbial metabolism that are largely in congruence with the current paradigm established in marine systems. This study provides a foundation for future hypotheses regarding the dynamics of viral-mediated processes in the rumen."

This diversity has evolved by repeated transmission of IAVs from humans to swine and subsequent antigenic drift in swine. To understand the evolutionary dynamics of these diverse HA lineages in North American swine, we undertook a phylogenetic analysis of 1576 H1 and 607 H3 HA gene segments, as well as 834 N1 and 1293 N2 NA gene segments, and 2126 M gene segments. These data revealed yearly co-circulation of H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 viruses, with three HA clades representing the majority of the HA sequences: of the H1 viruses, 42% were classified as H1Î´1 and 40.6% were classified as H1Î³; and of the H3 viruses 53% were classified as cluster IV-A H3N2. We detected a genetically distinct minor clade consisting of 37 H1 viruses isolated between 2003 and 2013, which we classified as H1Î³-2. We estimated that this clade circulated in swine since approximately 1995, but it was not detected in swine until 2003. Though this clade only represents 1.07% of swine H1 sequences reported over the past 10 years, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays demonstrated that representatives of this clade of viruses are antigenically distinct, and, when measured using antigenic cartography, were as many as 7 antigenic units from other H1Î³ viruses. Therefore vaccines against the contemporary H1Î³ viruses are not likely to cross-protect against Î³-2 viruses. The long-term circulation of these Î³-2 viruses suggests that minor populations of viruses may be underreported in the national dataset given the long branch lengths and gaps in detections. The identification of these Î³-2 viruses demonstrates the need for robust surveillance to capture the full diversity IAVs in swine in the USA and the importance of antigenic drift in the diversification and emergence of new antigenic variants in swine, which complicates vaccine design."

For influenza A viruses (IAVs) in swine, understanding the hemagglutinin (HA) genetic lineage of a circulating strain aids in vaccine antigen selection and allows for inferences about vaccine efficacy. Previous reporting of H1 virus HA in swine relied on colloquial names, frequently with incriminating and stigmatizing geographic toponyms, making comparisons between studies challenging. To overcome this, we developed an adaptable nomenclature using measurable criteria for historical and contemporary evolutionary patterns of H1 global swine IAVs. We also developed a web-accessible tool that classifies viruses according to this nomenclature. This classification system will aid agricultural production and pandemic preparedness through the identification of important changes in swine IAVs and provides terminology enabling discussion of swine IAVs in a common context among animal and human health initiatives.</jats:p>"

At present no antiviral drugs are available for NiV disease and the treatment is just supportive. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses can be used to help in understanding the epidemiology and the temporal origin of this virus. This review provides an overview of evolutionary studies performed on Nipah viruses circulating in different countries.

Here we applied a broad genetic and phylogenetic analysis of a wide range of influenza virus genes, in particular the PB1 gene, to gain information about the phylogenetic relatedness of the 1918 H1N1 virus. We compared the RNA genome of the 1918 strain to many other influenza strains of different origin by several means, including relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), effective number of codons (ENC), and phylogenetic relationship. We found that the PB1 gene of the 1918 pandemic virus had ENC values similar to the H1N1 classical swine and human viruses, but different ENC values from avian as well as H2N2 and H3N2 human viruses. Also, according to the RSCU of the PB1 gene, the 1918 virus grouped with all human isolates and ""classical"" swine H1N1 viruses. The phylogenetic studies of all eight RNA gene segments of influenza A viruses may indicate that the 1918 pandemic strain originated from a H1N1 swine virus, which itself might be derived from a H1N1 avian precursor, which was separated from the bulk of other avian viruses in toto a long time ago. The high stability of the RSCU pattern of the PB1 gene indicated that the integrity of RNA structure is more important for influenza virus evolution than previously thought."

Based on partial haemagglutinin gene sequence, this virus has a close genetic relationship with subtype H5N8 viruses circulating in Asia and Europe. Pathologically, H5N8 virus in hybrid duck induced nervous signs accompanied by encephalomalacia, haemorrhages, nonsuppurative encephalitis and nonsuppurative vasculitis. The granular layer of cerebellum showed multifocal areas of hydropic degeneration and the Purkinje cell neurons were necrotized or lost. Additionally, the lung, kidney and spleen were congested, and necrotizing pancreatitis was also observed. The co-circulation of both HPAI H5N1 and H5N8 subtypes with the low pathogenic avian influenza H9N2 subtype complicate the control of avian influenza in Egypt with the possibility of emergence of new reassortant viruses. Therefore, continuous monitoring with implementation of strict control measures is required.

Five of 300 liver samples from Himalayan marmots were positive for HMBOV1 and five of 99 fecal samples from these animals for HMBOV2. Their nearly complete genome sequences are 4,672 and 4,887 nucleotides long, respectively, with a standard genomic organization and containing protein-coding motifs typical for BOVs. Based on their NS1, NP1, and VP1, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 are most closely related to porcine BOV SX/1-2 (approximately 77.0%/50.0%, 50.0%/53.0%, and 79.0%/54.0% amino acid identity, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis of these three proteins showed that HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 formed two distinctly independent branches in BOVs.

Linking the epidemiological and sequence data is important to understand the transmission, persistence and evolution of the virus. This work describes the phylogenetic dynamics of H5N1 based on molecular characterization of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of isolates collected from February 2006 to May 2014. Full-length HA sequences of 368 H5N1 viruses were generated and were genetically analysed to study their genetic evolution. They were collected from different poultry species, production sectors, and geographic locations in Egypt. The Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) method was applied to estimate the evolutionary rates among different virus clusters; additionally, an analysis of selection pressures in the HA gene was performed using the Single Likelihood Ancestor Counting (SLAC) method. The phylogenetic analysis of the H5 gene from 2006-14 indicated the presence of one virus introduction of the classic clade (2.2.1) from which two main subgroups were originated, the variant subgroup which was further subdivided into 2 sub-divisions (2.2.1.1 and 2.2.1.1a) and the endemic subgroup (2.2.1.2). The clade 2.2.1.2 showed a high evolution rate over a period of 6 years (6.9 Ã 10(-3) sub/site/year) in comparison to the 2.2.1.1a variant cluster (7.2 Ã 10(-3) over a period of 4 years). Those two clusters are under positive selection as they possess 5 distinct positively selected sites in the HA gene. The mutations at 120, 154, and 162 HA antigenic sites and the other two mutations (129â, I151T) that occurred from 2009-14 were found to be stable in the 2.2.1.2 clade. Additionally, 13 groups of H5N1 HPAI viruses were identified based on their amino acid sequences at the cleavage site and ""EKRRKKR"" became the dominant pattern beginning in 2013. Continuous evolution of H5N1 HPAI viruses in Egypt has been observed in all poultry farming and production systems in almost all regions of the country. The wide circulation of the 2.2.1.2 clade carrying triple mutations (120, 129â, I151T) associated with increased binding affinity to human receptors is an alarming finding of public health importance."

The nucleotide sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin gene of the isolated Egyptian virus showed the highest similarity with one group of recent Israeli strains (97 %) circulating from 2006-2010. Sequence homology and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Qa/Egypt/11 isolate belonged to the A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/1997-like lineage with new mutations identified in all viral proteins. The phylogenetic analysis for the eight genes indicated placement of the Egyptian virus within the same lineage of H9N2 viruses that circulated in the region from 2006, especially with one group of recent Israeli strains. However, phylogenetic analysis of the internal genes like PB2, NP, and PA genes identified possible reassortment events for these genes with singular Israeli strains. This study indicates progressive evolution of this subtype in the Middle East region and possible mechanism of virus adaptation in land-based poultry like in quails."

The outbreak was related to the widespread circulation of closely related clades, or groups, of West Nile virus (WNV) into multiple states where they were not previously found. Whether the invading 2012 strains were able to circulate and overwinter in states with their own endemic population of WNV is unknown and the effect of viral genetics on adaptation and persistence in a new ecological niche is unclear. In this study, we sequenced 70 mosquito isolates from multiple counties throughout Texas in 2012-2015. We identified isolates representative of previously described 2012 WNV groups (Groups 8-10) and discovered a novel group which we called Group 11. Although we identified isolates representative of WNV endemic (2/70) to Texas, most isolates (68/70) were related to the invading 2012 strains, and of these Group 10 (45/68) was predominant. We also observed differences among the 2012 WNV groups correlating to their genotype. Group 10 WNV in Texas, which carry two putative positively selected variants, had limited introductions into Texas, wide circulation, and strong evidence of continued persistence perhaps indicative of overwintering. In contrast, Groups 8 and 11, without positively selected variants, had multiple introductions into Texas, limited circulation, and limited persistence. Lastly, we identified a potential transmission source in New York for incoming Group 8 WNV into Texas. Altogether our study suggests that mutations in the WNV genome may influence the range and dynamics of WNV circulation, and the ability of different strains to persist in new ecological niches."

Phylogenetic trees of these two antigens show that the sequences of the NIV viruses are relatively homogeneous and these were derived from several viruses circulating in swine. The phylogenetic tree of HA shows that NIV had the closest relationship with North-American pig lineages whereas NA had with European pig lineages. In both segments, NIVs had the closest genetic relationship with swine influenza virus lineages. It strongly suggests that pigs are the most possible animal reservoir. Comparative analysis shows that among clade A, NIVs had very low genetic divergence as well as high similarity and also suffered strong purifying selection whereas neighbor clade B shows moderate values when compared to those of clades C-F. It indicates that classical swine influenza viruses present in clade B might be an ancestor of NIVs external antigens. The process of re-assortment occurred in classical swine influenza viruses. The mutation sites exclusively fixed in the NIV of swine and human along with vaccine strain provide an important suggestion for disease diagnosis and vaccine research."

Mosquitoes are an integral part of these arthropod vectors. Advancements in next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics has expanded our knowledge on the richness of viruses harbored by arthropods. In the present study, we applied a metagenomic approach to determine the intercontinental virome diversity of Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex tritaeniorhynchus in Kwale, Kenya and provinces of Hubei and Yunnan in China. Our results showed that viromes from the three locations were strikingly diverse and comprised 30 virus families specific to vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and protozoa as well as unclassified group of viruses. Though sampled at different times, both Kwale and Hubei mosquito viromes were dominated by vertebrate viruses, in contrast to the Yunnan mosquito virome, which was dominated by insect-specific viruses. However, each virome was unique in terms of virus proportions partly influenced by type of ingested meals (blood, nectar, plant sap, environment substrates). The dominant vertebrate virus family in the Kwale virome was Papillomaviridae (57%) while in Hubei it was Herpesviridae (30%) and the Yunnan virome was dominated by an unclassified viruses group (27%). Given that insect-specific viruses occur naturally in their hosts, they should be the basis for defining the viromes. Hence, the dominant insect-specific viruses in Kwale, Hubei, and Yunnan were Baculoviridae, Nimaviridae and Iflaviridae, respectively. Our study is preliminary but contributes to growing and much needed knowledge, as mosquito viromes could be manipulated to prevent and control pathogenic arboviruses.</jats:p>"

Bdellovibrio has potential as a biocontrol agent, but no reports of it being tested in living animals have been published, and no data on whether Bdellovibrio might spread between animals are available. In this study, we tried to fill this knowledge gap, using B. bacteriovorus HD100 doses in poultry with a normal gut microbiota or predosed with a colonizing Salmonella strain. In both cases, Bdellovibrio was dosed orally along with antacids. After dosing non-Salmonella-infected birds with Bdellovibrio, we measured the health and well-being of the birds and any changes in their gut pathology and culturable microbiota, finding that although a Bdellovibrio dose at 2 days of age altered the overall diversity of the natural gut microbiota in 28-day-old birds, there were no adverse effects on their growth and well-being. Drinking water and fecal matter from the pens in which the birds were housed as groups showed no contamination by Bdellovibrio after dosing. Predatory Bdellovibrio orally administered to birds that had been predosed with a gut-colonizing Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis phage type 4 strain (an important zoonotic pathogen) significantly reduced Salmonella numbers in bird gut cecal contents and reduced abnormal cecal morphology, indicating reduced cecal inflammation, compared to the ceca of the untreated controls or a nonpredatory ÎpilA strain, suggesting that these effects were due to predatory action. This work is a first step to applying Bdellovibrio therapeutically for other animal, and possibly human, infections."

To further understand its complex epidemiology, which involves multiple virus serotypes and host species, we characterized the viruses recovered from FMD outbreaks in Ethiopia during 1981-2007. We detected 5 of the 7 FMDV serotypes (O, A, C, Southern African Territories [SAT] 1, and SAT 2). Serotype O predominated, followed by serotype A; type C was not recognized after 1983. Phylogenetic analysis of virus protein 1 sequences indicated emergence of a new topotype within serotype O, East Africa 4. In 2007, serotype SAT 1 was detected in Ethiopia and formed a new distinct topotype (IX), and serotype SAT 2 reappeared after an apparent gap of 16 years. The diversity of viruses highlights the role of this region as a reservoir for FMD virus, and their continuing emergence in Ethiopia will greatly affect spread and consequent control strategy of the disease on this continent."

In recent years, HCV-related sequences have been found in bats, rodents, horses, and dogs, indicating a widespread distribution of hepaciviruses among animals. By applying unbiased high-throughput sequencing, a novel virus of the genus Hepacivirus was discovered in a bovine serum sample. De novo assembly yielded a nearly full-length genome coding for a polyprotein of 2,779 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the virus represents a novel species within the genus Hepacivirus. Viral RNA screening determined that 1.6% (n = 5) of 320 individual animals and 3.2% (n = 5) of 158 investigated cattle herds in Germany were positive for bovine hepacivirus. Repeated reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses of animals from one dairy herd proved that a substantial percentage of cows were infected, with some of them being viremic for over 6 months. Clinical and postmortem examination revealed no signs of disease, including liver damage. Interestingly, quantitative RT-PCR from different organs and tissues, together with the presence of an miR-122 binding site in the viral genome, strongly suggests a liver tropism for bovine hepacivirus, making this novel virus a promising animal model for HCV infections in humans. Livestock animals act as important sources for emerging pathogens. In particular, their large herd size and the existence of multiple ways of direct and food-borne infection routes emphasize their role as virus reservoirs. Apart from the search for novel viruses, detailed characterization of these pathogens is indispensable in the context of risk analysis. Here, we describe the identification of a novel HCV-like virus in cattle. In addition, determination of the prevalence and of the course of infection in cattle herds provides valuable insights into the biology of this novel virus. The results presented here form a basis for future studies targeting viral pathogenesis of bovine hepaciviruses and their potential to establish zoonotic infections."

However, interspecies transmission had occasionally caused outbreaks in various hosts including humans. To characterize the genetic origins of H5 avian influenza viruses isolated from migratory birds in South Korea, phylogenetic analysis were conducted. A total of 53 H5 viruses were isolated between October 2005 and November 2008. Full genetic characterization indicated that most of these viruses belong to the Eurasian-like avian lineage. However, some segments of the AB/Korea/W235/07 and the AB/Korea/W236/07 isolates were clustered with North American lineage viruses rather than those of the Eurasian lineage, suggesting the occurrence of reassortment between these two avian virus lineages. Phylogenetic analysis further demonstrated that the H5N2 and H5N3 virus isolates were of the low pathogenicity H5 phenotype. The H5 viruses appear to be antigenically similar to each other, but could be distinguished from a recent HPAI H5N1 (EM/Korea/W149/06) virus by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assays. Experimental inoculation of representative viruses indicated that certain isolates, particularly AB/Korea/W163/07 (H5N2), could be detected in trachea and lungs of chickens but none could be transmitted by direct contact. Furthermore, all of the viruses could be detected in mice lung without prior adaptation which is indicative of their pathogenic potential in a mammalian host. Overall, our results emphasize the important role that migratory birds play in the perpetuation, transport, and reassortment of avian influenza viruses stressing the need for continued surveillance of influenza virus activity in these avian populations."

As an ideal delivery vehicle, it has the ability to protect the cargo molecules in the presence of serum, nucleases and has minimal or no cytotoxicity at even higher peptide concentrations studied.

Consequent targeted research is revealing bats to be infected with a rich diversity of novel viruses. Poxviruses were recently identified in bats and the settings in which they were found were dramatically different. Here, we review the natural history of poxviruses in bats and highlight the relationship of the viruses to each other and their context in the Poxviridae family. In addition to considering the zoonotic potential of these viruses, we reflect on the broader implications of these findings. Specifically, the potential to explore and exploit this newfound relationship to study coevolution and cross species transmission together with fundamental aspects of poxvirus host tropism as well as bat virology and immunology."

Recent studies have shown a great diversity of paramyxoviruses in an urban-roosting population of straw-colored fruit bats in Ghana. Here, we investigate this further through virus isolation and describe two novel rubulaviruses: Achimota virus 1 (AchPV1) and Achimota virus 2 (AchPV2). The viruses form a phylogenetic cluster with each other and other bat-derived rubulaviruses, such as Tuhoko viruses, Menangle virus, and Tioman virus. We developed AchPV1- and AchPV2-specific serological assays and found evidence of infection with both viruses in Eidolon helvum across sub-Saharan Africa and on islands in the Gulf of Guinea. Longitudinal sampling of E. helvum indicates virus persistence within fruit bat populations and suggests spread of AchPVs via horizontal transmission. We also detected possible serological evidence of human infection with AchPV2 in Ghana and Tanzania. It is likely that clinically significant zoonotic spillover of chiropteran paramyxoviruses could be missed throughout much of Africa where health surveillance and diagnostics are poor and comorbidities, such as infection with HIV or Plasmodium sp., are common."

In this study, sequence and phylogenetic analyses of structural protein genes, namely the nucleocapsid (N), the matrix (M), the fusion (F) and the haemagglutinin (H) coding sequences of virulent and vaccine strains of PPR virus (PPRV), were undertaken to determine the genetic variations between field isolates and vaccine strains. The open reading frame (ORF) of these genes of the isolates/strains was amplified by RT-PCR, cloned and sequenced. The ORF of N, M, F and H genes was 1578, 1008, 1641 and 1830 nucleotides (nt) in length and encodes polypeptides of 525, 335, 546 and 609 amino acids (aa), respectively, as reported earlier. Comparative sequence analyses of these four genes of isolates/strains were carried out with published sequences. It revealed an identity of 97.7-100% and 97.7-99.8% among the Asian lineage IV and 89.6-98.7% and 89.8-98.9% with other lineages of PPRV at nt and aa levels, respectively. The phylogenetic analyses of these isolates based on the aa sequences showed that all the viruses belonged to lineage IV along with other Asian isolates. This is in agreement with earlier observations that only PPRV lineage IV is in circulation in India since the disease was first reported. Further, sequence analysis of the thermostable/thermo-adapted vaccine strains showed no significant changes in the functional or structural surface protein-coding gene sequences. It is important to monitor the circulation of the PPRV in susceptible animals by H gene-based sequence comparisons in addition to the F gene- and N gene-based approaches to identify the distribution and spread of virus in the regular outbreaks that occur in endemic countries like India."

The disease presents multi-systemic clinical signs (respiratory, renal, enteric, and reproductive) and is caused by one coronavirus (infectious bronchitis virus, IBV). Infectious bronchitis virus is classified into different serotypes and genotypes (vaccine strains and field variants). This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of IBV in commercial poultry flocks from 3 important producing regions in Brazil and to determine the tropism of the main circulating genotypes to 3 different avian physiological systems (respiratory, digestive, urinary/reproductive). Clinical samples with suggestive signs of IBV infection were collected from 432 different poultry commercial flocks (198 from broilers and 234 from breeders). The total number of biological samples consisted of organ pools from the 3 above physiological systems obtained of farms from 3 important producing regions: midwest, northeast, and south. Infectious bronchitis virus was detected by reverse-transcription, real-time PCR of the 5' untranslated region. The results showed 179 IBV-positive flocks (41.4% of the flocks), with 107 (24.8%) from broilers and 72 (16.8%) from breeders. There were similar frequencies of IBV-positive flocks in farms from different regions of the country, most often in broilers (average 54%) compared with breeders (average 30.8%). reverse-transcription was more frequently detected in the digestive system of breeders (40%), and in the digestive (43.5%) and respiratory (37.7%) systems of broilers. Infectious bronchitis virus genotyping was performed by a reverse-transcription nested PCR and sequencing of the S1 gene from a selection of 79 IBV-positive flocks (45 from broilers and 34 from breeders). The majority of the flocks were infected with Brazilian variant genotype than with Massachusetts vaccine genotype. These results demonstrate the predominance of the Brazilian variant (mainly in the enteric tract) in commercial poultry flocks from 3 important producing regions in Brazil."

The recombinant isolation frequency was about 10(-9) recombinants per nucleotide and was 3.7-fold higher at the 5'-end of the S gene than in other areas of the genome. Thirty recombinants were plaque purified and characterized phenotypically and genetically. All recombinant viruses had a single crossover and had inherited the 5'- and 3'-halves of their genome from the enteric and respiratory parents, respectively. Recombinant viruses were classified into three groups, named 1 to 3, according to the location of the crossover. Group 1 recombinants had the crossover in the S gene, while in Groups 2 and 3 the crossovers were located in ORF1b and ORF1a, respectively. The tropism of the recombinants was studied. Recombinants of Group 1 had enteric and respiratory tropism, while Group 2 recombinants infected the respiratory, but not the enteric, tract. Viruses of both groups differed by two nucleotide changes at positions 214 and 655. Both changes may be in principle responsible for the loss of enteric tropism but only the change in nucleotide 655 was specifically found in the respiratory isolates and most likely this single nucleotide change, which leads to a substitution in amino acid 219 of the S protein, was responsible for the loss of enteric tropism in the closely related PUR46 isolates. The available data indicate that in order to infect enteric tract cells with TGEV, two different domains of the S protein, mapping between amino acids 522 and 744 and around amino acid 219, respectively, are involved. The first domain binds to porcine aminopeptidase N, the cellular receptor for TGEV. In the other domain maps a second factor of undefined nature but which may be the binding site for a coreceptor essential for the enteric tropism of TGEV."

The virus was identified in Hungary during 2011 in a flock of turkey vaccinated against avipoxvirus infection. The genome of the isolated strain, TKPV-HU1124/2011, was uniquely short (â¼188.5kbp) and was predicted to encode reduced number of proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of the genes encoding the 4b and DNA polymerase separated TKPV-HU1124/2011 from other turkey origin avipoxviruses and classified it into a new genetic clade. This study permits new insight into the genetic and genomic heterogeneity of avipoxviruses and pinpoints the importance of strain diversity in vaccine efficacy."

The research was undertaken to study the infection of PPR virus (PPRV) in free-living bharals (Pseudois nayaur) in Tibet, China. In 2007, PPRV infection was confirmed in two bharals in Rutog County of Tibet based on clinical signs and detection of PPRV RNA in tissue samples. In 2008, PPRV infection was found in one bharal in Ge'gyai County of Tibet by competitive ELISA, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and sequence analysis of PPRV fusion protein (F) and nucleoprotein (N) gene segments. The PPRV variant identified in infected bharal was closely related to other circulating PPRV variants recently identified in sheep and goats from Tibet. This is the first report of PPRV infection in free-living bharals."

REV causes a series of pathological syndromes, especially the immunosuppression of the host, which may lead to an increased susceptibility to other pathogens, thus greatly damaging the poultry industry. Mixed infections of REV and Marek's disease virus (MDV) have been reported in many countries, including China. Previous reports revealed that MDV vaccines were not efficacious, and even less-virulent MDV strains would cause some losses due to mixed infections with REV. Additionally, contaminants in the MDV vaccine might be the main source of REV. In this study, two clinical samples were collected from two flocks of chickens that were diagnosed with MDV. Subsequently, two REV isolates were obtained from the clinical samples. The isolates, named CY1111 and SY1209, were further confirmed through an indirect immunofluorescence assay and electron microscopy. Complete genome sequences of the two REV strains were determined to test the relationship between them and other REV strains. Phylogenetic trees showed that the two REV strains were closely related to most REV strains that were isolated from a variety of hosts. Therefore, REVs might spread freely among these hosts under natural conditions. Additionally, most REV strains in China were in the same clade. The present work offers some information regarding REV in China."

In 2011, a novel Orthobunyavirus was discovered in northern Europe causing congenital malformations and abortions in ruminants. From field studies, Culicoides were implicated in the transmission of this virus which was subsequently named Schmallenberg virus (SBV), but to date no assessment of susceptibility to infection of field populations under standardised laboratory conditions has been carried out. We assessed the influence of membrane type (chick skin, collagen, Parafilm MÂ®) when offered in conjunction with an artificial blood-feeding system (Hemotek, UK) on field-collected Culicoides blood-feeding rates. Susceptibility to infection with SBV following blood-feeding on an SBV-blood suspension provided via either (i) the Hemotek system or via (ii) a saturated cotton wool pledglet was then compared. Schmallenberg virus susceptibility was defined by RT-qPCR of RNA extractions of head homogenates and related to Culicoides species and haplotype identifications based on the DNA barcode region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (cox1) gene. Culicoides blood-feeding rates were low across all membrane types tested (7.5% chick skin, 0.0% for collagen, 4.4% Parafilm MÂ®, with 6029 female Culicoides being offered a blood meal in total). Susceptibility to infection with SBV through membrane blood-feeding (8 of 109 individuals tested) and pledglet blood-feeding (1 of 94 individuals tested) was demonstrated for the Obsoletus complex, with both C. obsoletus (Meigen) and C. scoticus Downes & Kettle susceptible to infection with SBV through oral feeding. Potential evidence of cryptic species within UK populations was found for the Obsoletus complex in phylogenetic analyses of cox1 DNA barcodes of 74 individuals assessed from a single field-site. Methods described in this study provide the means to blood-feed Palaearctic Culicoides for vector competence studies and colonisation attempts. Susceptibility to SBV infection was 7.3% for membrane-fed members of the subgenus Avaritia and 1.1% for pledglet-fed. Both C. obsoletus and C. scoticus were confirmed as being susceptible to infection with SBV, with potential evidence of cryptic species within UK Obsoletus complex specimens, however the implications of cryptic diversity in the Obsoletus complex on arbovirus transmission remains unknown."

The protease gene sequence of ovine adenovirus type 3 (OAdV-3) was determined and analysed. The results of phylogenetic analysis of the 205 residue long protein demonstrated that OAdV-3 belongs to the genus Mastadenovirus, and is surprisingly closely related to bovine adenovirus type 2. In spite of the common host origin, the evolutionary distance between OAdV-3 and OAV287 proved to be great suggesting that sheep, similarly to cattle and fowl, might be infected by distantly related adenoviruses belonging to different genera."

Such an understanding of the relatedness of newly discovered filoviruses may help to predict risk factors for outbreaks of hemorrhagic disease in humans and/or non-human primates. Recent discoveries such as three distinct genotypes of Reston ebolavirus, unexpectedly discovered in domestic swine in the Philippines; as well as a new species, Bundibugyo ebolavirus; the recent discovery of Lloviu virus as a potential new genus, Cuevavirus, within Filoviridae; and germline integrations of filovirus-like sequences in some animal species bring new insights into the relatedness of filoviruses, their prevalence and potential for transmission to humans. These new findings reveal that filoviruses are more diverse and may have had a greater influence on the evolution of animals than previously thought. Herein we review these findings with regard to the implications for understanding the host range, prevalence and transmission of Filoviridae."

MDV productively and cytolytically infects B, alphabetaT and gammadeltaT lymphocytes and latently infects T-helper lymphocytes. The aims of this study were to identify whether MDV infects macrophages in vivo and, if so, whether quantitative differences in macrophage infection are associated with MDV strain virulence. Chickens were infected with either virulent MDV (HPRS-16) or 'hypervirulent' MDV (C12/130). Flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies recognizing MDV pp38 antigen and leukocyte antigens was used to identify MDV lytically infected cells. Macrophages from HPRS-16- and C12/130-infected chickens were pp38(+). It is demonstrated that macrophages are pp38(+) because they are infected and not because they have phagocytosed MDV antigens, as assessed by confocal microscopy using antibodies recognizing MDV antigens of the three herpesvirus kinetic classes: infected cell protein 4 (ICP4, immediate early), pp38 (early) and glycoprotein B (gB, late). Spleen macrophages from MDV-infected chickens were ICP4(+), pp38(+) and gB(+), and ICP4 had nuclear localization denoting infection. Finally, MDV pp38(+) macrophages had high inherent death rates, confirming cytolytic MDV infection, although production of virus particles has not been detected yet. These results have two fundamental implications for understanding MDV pathogenesis: (i) MDV evolved to perturb innate, in addition to acquired, immunity and (ii) macrophages are excellent candidates for transporting MDV to primary lymphoid organs during the earliest stages of pathogenesis."

To date, at least 160 tick-borne viruses are known, some of them pose a significant threat to human and animal health worldwide. Recently, a number of established TBVs has re-emerged and spread to new geographic locations due to the influence of anthropogenic activities and few available vaccines. Moreover, new emerging tick-borne diseases are constantly being reported. Major advances in molecular biotechnologies have led to discoveries of new TBVs and further genetic characterization of unclassified viruses resulting in changes in TBVs classification created by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses. Although TBVs spend over 95% of their life cycle within tick vectors and the role of ticks as vectors has been known for over 100 years, our knowledge about TBVs and molecular processes involved in the virus-tick interactions is scarce."

Influenza A seroprevalence in the local slaughterhouses and in the large collective slaughterhouse was 48.7% and 29.1%, respectively. Seventy-seven influenza A viruses were isolated, all from the large collective slaughterhouse. Genetic analysis revealed six virus genotypes including H1N1 2009 pandemic (H1N1pdm09) viruses, H1N2 with H1 of human origin, H3N2 and H1N1pdm09 reassortants, and triple-reassortant H3N2 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of swine and human H1N1pdm09 viruses showed evidence of repeated spill-over from humans to swine rather than the establishment of H1N1pdm09 as long-term distinct lineage in swine.

Here, we describe the identification and genetic characterization of a new BPV type in the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus. A farm in the state of New York, USA, reported chronic cases of vulvovaginitis in Holstein cows in 2016. Biopsies and/or swab samples collected from the vaginal mucosa were subjected to diagnostic investigation. Conventional diagnostic assays yielded negative results, and vaginal swab samples were subjected to viral metagenomic sequencing. Notably, BLAST searches revealed a papillomavirus genome with 7480 bp in length (67% nt sequence identity to BPV16). Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of the L1 gene of the papillomavirus identified here (tentatively named BPV22) revealed that it clusters with members of the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus. Interestingly, the recently identified BPV16, which was detected in fibropapilloma lesions in cattle also clusters within the Dyokappapapillomavirus group. Each virus, however, forms a separate branch in the phylogenetic tree. These results indicate that the putative BPV22 represents the second BPV within the genus Dyokappapapillomavirus."

Using real-time PCR for PCV1, titres of PCV1 DNA in several batches of Rotarix were found to be in the order of 6-7 log(10) copies per dose. Pre-treatment of the reconstituted vaccine with the nuclease Benzonase, followed by extraction of nucleic acid and quantification of PCV1 DNA by real-time PCR, revealed that there was no loss of PCV1 DNA titre compared to untreated controls, suggesting that the porcine viral DNA was present in the vaccine in an encapsidated form. PCV1 permissive PS cells, human HEK293 and Vero cells, used for vaccine production, were infected with Rotarix or PCV1, respectively, and subjected to immune fluorescence and RT-PCR. Viral genomes were present in Rotarix-incubated as well as PCV1-infected cells, while viral transcription was seen only in PCV1-infected cells. Similarly, PCV1-specific protein expression was observed in PCV1-infected cells, but not in cells treated with Rotarix. Passaging of the supernatant indicated productive infection in PCV1-infected PS cells, but not in HEK293 and Vero cells or in any cell line incubated with Rotarix. PCV1 DNA present in Rotarix was protected from Benzonase digestion; however, PCV1 was not recognized in immune electron microscopy and unable to infect PS, HEK293 or Vero cells, suggesting that the high amount of PCV1 DNA present in Rotarix does not reflect a corresponding proportion of biologically active virus particles."

To further address the issue of heterogeneity of pestiviruses we have determined the entire N(pro) and E2 coding sequences for several new pestivirus isolates. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis revealed that one pestivirus isolated in the 1990s in Africa is closely related to strain H138. Moreover, several novel pestiviruses isolated from sheep group together with the previously described strain V60 (Reindeer-1) isolated from a reindeer, whereas one ovine pestivirus strain (Gifhorn) significantly differs from all previously described pestiviruses, including BDV. We propose to term these mainly sheep-derived pestiviruses BDV-2 (V60-like isolates) and BDV-3 (Gifhorn); consequently, the ""classical"" BDV isolates should be termed BDV-1. As an additional criterion for segregation of pestiviruses, the antigenic relatedness of pestivirus isolates covering all observed major genotypes was studied by cross-neutralization assays. Analysis of the antigenic similarities indicated the presence of seven major antigenic groups corresponding to BVDV-1, BVDV-2, CSFV, BDV-1, BDV-2, BDV-3, and ""giraffe"". Taking into account the host origin, the lack of differences concerning the course of disease, and the results of our genetic and antigenic analyses, we suggest that BDV-1, BDV-2, and BDV-3 should be considered as major genotypes within the species BDV."

The development of novel technologies can only be successful if they are transferred and used in the field with a sustainable quality-assured application to allow for the optimal detection and effective control of diseases. The aim of these new tools is to detect the presence of a pathogen agent before the onset of disease. This manuscript focuses mainly on the experiences of two World Organisation for Animal Health collaborating centers in context to molecular diagnosis and molecular epidemiology of transboundary and endemic animal diseases of viral origin, food safety and zoonoses."

However, both techniques have difficulties to identify viruses in clinical samples because of the host genomic nucleic acid content (hg/cont). Both propidium monoazide (PMA) and ethidium bromide monoazide (EMA) have the capacity to bind free DNA/RNA, but are cell membrane-impermeable. Thus, both are unable to bind protected nucleic acid such as viral genomes within intact virions. However, EMA/PMA modified genetic material cannot be amplified by enzymes. In order to assess the potential of EMA/PMA to lower the presence of amplifiable hg/cont in samples and improve virus detection, serum and lung tissue homogenates were spiked with porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV) and were processed with EMA/PMA. In addition, PRRSV RT-qPCR positive clinical samples were also tested. EMA/PMA treatments significantly decreased amplifiable hg/cont and significantly increased the number of PVDA positive probes and their signal intensity compared to untreated spiked lung samples. EMA/PMA treatments also increased the sensitivity of HTS by increasing the number of specific PRRSV reads and the PRRSV percentage of coverage. Interestingly, EMA/PMA treatments significantly increased the sensitivity of PVDA and HTS in two out of three clinical tissue samples. Thus, EMA/PMA treatments offer a new approach to lower the amplifiable hg/cont in clinical samples and increase the success of PVDA and HTS to identify viruses."

The disease is associated with severe respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological lesions in chicken leading to high mortality and several other production related losses. The aetiology of the disease is an avian paramyxovirus type-1 or Newcastle disease virus (NDV), whose isolates are serologically grouped into a single serotype but genetically classified into a total of 19 genotypes, owing to the continuous emergence and evolution of the virus. In Nigeria, molecular characterization of NDV is generally very scanty and majorly focuses on the amplification of the partial F gene for genotype assignment. However, with the introduction of the most objective NDV genotyping criteria which utilize complete fusion protein coding sequences in phylogenetic taxonomy, the enormous genetic diversity of the virus in Nigeria became very conspicuous. In this review, we examine the current ecological distribution of various NDV genotypes in Nigeria based on the available complete fusion protein nucleotide sequences (1662âbp) in the NCBI database. We then discuss the challenges of ND control as a result of the wide genetic distance between the currently circulating NDV isolates and the commonest vaccines used to combat the disease in the country. Finally, we suggest future directions in the war against the economically devastating ND in Nigeria."

Feral pigs (Sus scrofa) are a health problem when countries work to prevent and control zoonotic diseases, as their populations raise environmental and health concerns due to infectious agents transmissible to domestic pigs and other animal species, including humans. To prioritize zoonotic diseases in the feral pigs, domestic animals and humans interface. The semi-quantitative prioritization method based on evidence included 27 criteria founded in recent publications. According to viral etiology we classified them in five categories: epidemiology (eight), prevention/control (three), economy/trade (four), public health (nine) and society (three). Each criterion had a coefficient of 0 to 7 according to their impact based on evidence (maximum sum of 189). Evidence on the criteria for the nine viral diseases analyzed came from the review of 81 sources published between 1977 and 2015. The top three diseases with the highest score and zoonotic potential were swine influenza (133), hepatitis E (123), and hantavirus infection (103), whose highest scores were observed on epidemiology and public health criteria. The semi-quantitative methods of prioritization impartially contribute to decision-making based on evidence; however, they are seldom used in developing countries due to the lack of data from public health surveillance. Control of shared diseases requires the development of strategies to reduce transmission of pathogens between wildlife and domestic animals and humans."

Sixteen viruses, including 6 from fatal cases, were isolated during this outbreak. Molecular analysis of the surface proteins genes encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of these H5N1 isolates, of a subtype not previously known to infect humans, are presented. The 16 human H5 HA sequences contain multiple basic amino acids adjacent to the cleavage site, a motif associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses. The phylogenetic relationship among both avian and human H5 hemagglutinins indicates that the human isolates are related directly to isolates that circulated among chickens in the live poultry markets in Hong Kong prior to and during the outbreak in humans. HA sequences from the human isolates and a recent chicken isolate represent a separate clade, within which there are two subgroups that are distinguishable antigenically and by the presence of a potential glycosylation site. Likewise the N1 neuraminidases of the human H5 isolates represent a clade that is evolutionarily distinct from previously characterized N1 neuraminidases. The recent human H5N1 virus NA genes are avian-like, indicating direct introduction from an avian source rather than evolution of a human N1 NA. All of the 16 human NA genes encode a shortened stalk due to a 19-amino acid deletion, also found in the recent avian H5N1 isolates from Hong Kong. Two unique amino acids were identified in the N1 NAs of the recent human isolates; however, it is not known if these residues influence host range. Neither the HA nor the NA genes of the human H5N1 virus isolates show evidence of adaptive changes during the outbreak. Although analyses of the surface protein genes of the H5N1 viruses from this outbreak did not provide immediate answers regarding the molecular basis for virulence, the analyses provided clues to potentially important areas of the genes worth further investigation."

The NCRs contain both conserved and segment-specific sequences, and the impacts of variability in the NCRs are not completely understood. Full NCRs have been determined from some viruses, but a detailed analysis of potential variability in these regions among viruses from different host groups and locations has not been performed. To evaluate the degree of conservation in NCRs among different viruses, we sequenced the NCRs of IAVs isolated from different wild bird host groups (ducks, gulls and seabirds). We then extended our study to include NCRs available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Influenza Virus Database, which allowed us to analyze a wider variety of host species and more HA and NA subtypes. We found that the amount of variability within the NCRs varies among segments, with the greatest variation found in the HA and NA and the least in the M and NS segments. Overall, variability in NCR sequences was correlated with the coding region phylogeny, suggesting vertical coevolution of the (coding sequence) CDS and NCR regions.</jats:p>"

CCHFV is maintained in vertical and horizontal transmission cycles involving ixodid ticks and a variety of wild and domestic vertebrates, which do not show signs of illness. The virus circulates in a number of tick genera, but Hyalomma ticks are the principal source of human infection, probably because both immature and adult forms actively seek hosts for the blood meals required at each stage of maturation. CCHF occurs most frequently among agricultural workers following the bite of an infected tick, and to a lesser extent among slaughterhouse workers exposed to the blood and tissues of infected livestock and medical personnel through contact with the body fluids of infected patients. CCHFV is the most genetically diverse of the arboviruses, with nucleotide sequence differences among isolates ranging from 20% for the viral S segment to 31% for the M segment. Viruses with diverse sequences can be found within the same geographic area, while closely related viruses have been isolated in far distant regions, suggesting that widespread dispersion of CCHFV has occurred at times in the past, possibly by ticks carried on migratory birds or through the international livestock trade. Reassortment among genome segments during co-infection of ticks or vertebrates appears to have played an important role in generating diversity, and represents a potential future source of novel viruses. In this article, we first review current knowledge of CCHFV, summarizing its molecular biology, maintenance and transmission, epidemiology and geographic range. We also include an extensive discussion of CCHFV genetic diversity, including maps of the range of the virus with superimposed phylogenetic trees. We then review the features of CCHF, including the clinical syndrome, diagnosis, treatment, pathogenesis, vaccine development and laboratory animal models of CCHF. The paper ends with a discussion of the possible future geographic range of the virus. For the benefit of researchers, we include a Supplementary Table listing all published reports of CCHF cases and outbreaks in the English-language literature, plus some principal articles in other languages, with total case numbers, case fatality rates and all CCHFV strains on GenBank."

The zoonotic infections reported from India signify the need to study the host-range genes-responsible for host tropism. We report sequence and phylogenetic analysis of five host-range genes: cytokine response modifier B (crmB), chemokine binding protein (ckbp), viral schlafen-like (v-slfn), myxomavirus T4-like (M-T4-like) and b5r of CMLVs isolated from outbreaks in India. Comparative analysis revealed that these genes are conserved among CMLVs and shared 94.5-100Â % identity at both nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) levels. All genes showed identity (59.3-98.4Â %) with cowpox virus (CPXV) while three genes-crmB, ckbp and b5r showed similarity (92-96.5Â %) with VARVs at both nt and aa levels. Interestingly, three consecutive serine residue insertions were observed in CKBP protein of CMLV-Delhi09 isolate which was similar to CPXV-BR and VACVs, besides five point mutations (K53Q, N67I, F84S, A127T and E182G) were also similar to zoonotic OPXVs. Further, few inconsistent point mutation(s) were also observed in other gene(s) among Indian CMLVs. These indicate that different strains of CMLVs are circulating in India and these mutations could play an important role in adaptation of CMLVs in humans. The phylogeny revealed clustering of all CMLVs together except CMLV-Delhi09 which grouped separately due to the presence of specific point mutations. However, the topology of the concatenated phylogeny showed close evolutionary relationship of CMLV with VARV and TATV followed by CPXV-RatGer09/1 from Germany. The availability of this genetic information will be useful in unveiling new strategies to control emerging zoonotic poxvirus infections."

The host tropism of poxviruses is governed by host-range genes. Among the host-range genes: E3L, K3L, and C7L are essential for virus replication by preventing interferon resistance, whereas B5R is essential for spread of the virus and evasion from the host's immune response as in VACV. We report sequence analysis of host-range genes: E3L, K3L, C7L, and membrane protein gene (B5R) of BPXVs from buffalo, cattle, and human from recent outbreaks in India-their phylogenetic relationship with reference strain (BP4) and other Orthopoxviruses. BPXVs revealed a sequence homology with VACVs including zoonotic Brazilian VACV-like viruses. The aa sequences of E3L and K3L genes were 100Â % similar in buffalo, cattle, and human isolates. However, four significant point mutations (I11K; N12K and S36F in C7L gene and D249G in B5R gene) were observed specific to buffalo isolate only. This signifies that different strains of BPXV were circulated during the outbreak. The mutations in C7L and B5R could play an important role in adaptation of BPXV in human and cattle which needs further functional studies. The strain of BPXV isolated from buffalo may not be adopted in human and cow. Various point mutations were observed in the host-range genes of reference strain (BPXV-BP4) which may be due to several passages of virus in cell culture. The phylogeny constructed based on concatenated gene sequences revealed that BPXVs are not as closely related to vaccine strain (Lister and Lister-derived strain-LC16m8), as hypothesized earlier, rather they are more closely related to reference strain (BPXV-BP4) and other vaccinia and vaccinia-like viruses such as Passatempo and Aracatuba viruses. The availability of information regarding host tropism determinants would allow us to understand molecular mechanism of species tropism of poxviruses which would be useful in unveiling new strategies to control zoonotic poxviral infections."

A high level of diversity was observed with up to 28,000 different viral genotypes obtained from each environment. The majority (~78%) of sequences did not match any previously described virus. Prophages outnumbered lytic phages approximately 2:1 with the most abundant bacteriophage and prophage types being associated with members of the dominant rumen phyla (Firmicutes and Proteobacteria). Metabolic profiling based on SEED subsystems revealed an enrichment of sequences with putative functional roles in DNA and protein metabolism, but a surprisingly low proportion of sequences assigned to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism.

While high-throughput metabarcoding has revolutionized the study of bacterial communities, generating comparable viral communities has proven elusive, particularly in wildlife samples where the diversity of viruses and limited quantities of viral nucleic acid present distinctive challenges. Metagenomic sequencing is a promising solution for studying viral communities, but the lack of standardized methods currently precludes comparisons across host taxa or localities. Here, we developed an untargeted shotgun metagenomic sequencing protocol to generate comparable viral communities from noninvasively collected faecal and oropharyngeal swabs. Using samples from common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus), a key species for virus transmission to humans and domestic animals, we tested how different storage media, nucleic acid extraction procedures and enrichment steps affect viral community detection. Based on finding viral contamination in foetal bovine serum, we recommend storing swabs in RNAlater or another nonbiological medium. We recommend extracting nucleic acid directly from swabs rather than from supernatant or pelleted material, which had undetectable levels of viral RNA. Results from a low-input RNA library preparation protocol suggest that ribosomal RNA depletion and light DNase treatment reduce host and bacterial nucleic acid, and improve virus detection. Finally, applying our approach to twelve pooled samples from seven localities in Peru, we showed that detected viral communities saturated at the attained sequencing depth, allowing unbiased comparisons of viral community composition. Future studies using the methods outlined here will elucidate the determinants of viral communities across host species, environments and time."

Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences, which included comparison with other rabies strains recovered from throughout the Americas, identified three main groups of Brazilian viruses, arbitrarily designated BRL-1 to BRL-3. BRL-1 was found in terrestrial carnivores and clusters with other American strains of the cosmopolitan lineage. BRL-2 comprised two distinct isolates, recovered from two species of non-haematophagous bats, that had evolutionary links to insectivorous-bat-derived strains of North America. BRL-3 consisted of isolates from vampire bats and from livestock species probably infected via contact with vampire bats. The terrestrial group was further subdivided into three subtypes: BRL-1a was associated exclusively with dogs and cats, while BRL-1b and BRL-1c were found exclusively in hoary foxes. These observations strongly support the role of the Brazilian hoary fox as a rabies reservoir. Screening of representative Brazilian rabies viruses against a collection of anti-rabies monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) identified a small panel of mAbs that could be used to discriminate between all Brazilian subgroups as defined by genetic classification in this study."

HHV-7 can also infect SUP-T1, an immature T-cell line, with variable success. Southern blot analysis with DNA probes scanning 58.8% of the human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) genome and hybridizing to all HHV-6 strains tested so far revealed homology to HHV-7 with only 37.4% of the total probe length.

DNA sequencing of a 186-base-pair fragment of HHV-7(JI) revealed an identity with HHV-6 and human cytomegalovirus of 57.5% and 36%, respectively. Oligonucleotide primers derived from this sequence (HV7/HV8, HV10/HV11) amplified HHV-7 DNA only and did not amplify DNA from other human herpesviruses, including 12 different HHV-6 strains. Southern blot analysis with the p43L3 probe containing the 186-base-pair HHV-7 DNA fragment hybridized to HHV-7 DNA only. The molecular divergence between human cytomegalovirus, on the one hand, and HHV-6 and HHV-7, on the other, is greater than between HHV-6 and HHV-7, which, in turn, is greater than the difference between HHV-6 strains.

Vaccination of all susceptible sheep and goats is the feasible and sustainable means of control. Availability of effective live attenuated vaccines that are inherently thermostable and development of improved diagnostics provide the opportunities to initiate effective control measures for capripox. All animals older than 4 months can be vaccinated with the current homologous vaccines using a single vaccination by intradermal or subcutaneous routes. The success of the control program needs to be monitored by active surveillance particularly for the presence of virus, as sero-monitoring does not enable the differentiation of infection and vaccination. And also the sero-conversion following capripox vaccination is not detectable enough by the available tools. Sustained control efforts call for socio-economic and political stability, adequate infrastructure and logistic support to store and transport vaccines for reaching out vaccines to the remote end users. Availability of veterinary services, improved extension services for increased awareness among farmers, contribute significantly to the control campaigns. Poor vaccination coverage and in-adequate infrastructure in major parts of the country are some of the major elements that come in the way of effective implementation of building herd immunity through immunization."

Various infectious diseases jeopardize the optimum productivity; among which sheep pox is more important as the disease restricts the export of sheep and their products besides other economic losses. Although, clinical signs are indicative of the disease but a laboratory confirmation is necessary for unequivocal diagnosis and studying epidemiology. The causative agent, sheep pox virus (SPV), is antigenically and genetically closely related to goat pox virus (GPV) and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), the other members of the genus capripox virus. In some countries, SPV and GPV are cross infective to small ruminants posing problem in diagnosis and epidemiology. However, recent studies have showed that the viruses are phylogenetically distinct and can be differentiated by molecular tools. Prophylaxis using attenuated vaccines is the choice of control measure as the immunity is long lasting. Detailed information on isolation, identification, pathology, epidemiology, diagnosis and prophylaxis would not only help in updating the knowledge of scientific fraternity but will be useful to the policy makers in order to formulate appropriate measures for control and eradication of the disease. This synthesis is to present an up-to-date review of the disease and its control to provide the reader with an overview of the problem."

Two different gene specific labeled fluorogenic probes for the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) were used to differentiate between BVD types I and II. Sensitivity of the single tube TaqMan assay was compared with two-tube TaqMan assay and standard RT-PCR using 10-fold dilutions of RNA. Single tube TaqMan assay was 10-100-fold more sensitive than the two-tube TaqMan assay and the standardized single tube RT-PCR. Specificity of the assay was evaluated by testing different BVD virus strains and other bovine viruses. A total of 106 BVD positive and negative pooled or single serum samples, field isolates and reference strains were tested. Quantitation of cRNA from types I and II BVD virus was accomplished by a standard curve plotting cycle threshold values (C(T)) versus copy number. Single tube TaqMan-PCR assay was sensitive, specific and rapid for detection, quantitation and classification of BVD virus."

The affected areas include the Central Asian, East Asian-Australasian, West Asian-East African, and Black Sea/Mediterranean flyways. These results show that the novel Clade 2.3.2.1c reassortant viruses are circulating worldwide and may have gained a selective advantage in migratory birds, thus posing a serious threat to wild birds and potentially humans."

Throughout the viral genome, several nucleotide or amino acid motifs that are conserved in circoviruses such as TT virus (TTV) and chicken anaemia virus were identified. Phylogenetic analysis distinguished three main groups of TLMV and allowed the identification of putative recombination breakpoints in the untranslated region. TLMV genomes were detected by PCR in the plasma of 38/50 French blood donors tested and were also identified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, faeces and saliva. A phylogenetic study of 37 TLMV strains originating from France, Japan and Brazil showed that groupings were not related to geographical origin.</jats:p>"

These sequences are also compared with partial G gene sequences of VSV IND type 2 (Cocal) and type 3 (Alagoas) viruses and the complete G gene sequences of the more distantly related VSV New Jersey (NJ) and Chandipura viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the G gene sequences by maximum parsimony revealed four major lineages or subtypes within the classical VSV IND (type 1) viruses, each with a distinct geographic distribution. A high degree of VSV genetic diversity was found in Central America, with several virus subtypes of both VSV IND and NJ serotypes existing in this mainly enzootic disease region. Nineteen percent sequence variation but no deletions or insertions were evident within the 5' noncoding and the coding regions of the VSV IND type 1 G genes. In addition to numerous base substitutions, the 3' noncoding regions of these viruses also contained numerous base insertions and deletions. This resulted in striking variation in G gene sizes, with gene lengths ranging from 1,652 to 1,868 nucleotides. As the VSV IND type 1 subtypes have diverged from the common ancestor with the NJ subtypes, their G mRNAs have accumulated more 3' noncoding sequence inserts, ranging up to 303 nucleotides in length. These primarily consist of an imprecise reiteration of the sequence UUUUUAA, apparently generated by a unique polymerase stuttering error. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence differences among VSV IND type 1 viruses revealed numerous substitutions within defined antigenic epitopes, suggesting that immune selection may play a role in the evolution of these viruses.</jats:p>"

To characterize the S1 protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) from China, five representative nephropathogenic IB viruses isolated from chickens in different provinces were genetically and phylogenetically analyzed. The results showed that the length of the S1 genes of the isolates were quite different (1,617, 1,620, 1,623, 1,629, and 1,632 nucleotides, respectively). The homology of the nucleotides and amino acids among the five isolates were 76.7%-92.1% and 73.9%-89.5%, respectively, indicating a great variation in S1 genes of the isolates. The variation in S1 genes might affect the antigenicity and pathogenicity of the viruses. Genetically, point mutations, insertions, and deletions in the S1 protein can be observed at many positions, especially at the first 150 amino acids in the N-terminal of the S1 protein. Two motif cleavage sites (R-R-X-R-R/S, H-R-R-R-R/S) were observed in the five sequenced strains. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that they belonged to different lineages. These findings indicated that different genotypes of nephropathogenic IB viruses were co-circulating in the chicken population in China."

KOOLV was shown previously to be related antigenically to kotonkon virus, an ephemerovirus that has caused an ephemeral fever-like illness in cattle in Nigeria, but YATV failed to react antigenically with any other virus tested. Here we report the complete genome sequences of KOOLV (16,133 nt) and YATV (14,479 nt). Each has a complex genome organisation, with multiple genes, including a second non-structural glycoprotein (GNS) gene and a viroporin (Î±1) gene, between the G and L genes as is characteristic of ephemeroviruses.

Microscopic findings consisted of acute, multifocal meningoencephalitis, with neuronal degeneration and necrosis and gliosis. Viral isolation yielded noncytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). Virus genotyping classified the virus as BVDV type 2. Immunohistochemical labeling for BVDV antigens with BVD MAb 3.12F1 clone was prominent in the cytoplasm of neurons, glial cells, ependymal epithelium, perivascular macrophages and spindle cells, smooth muscle cells, and intravascular monocytes of the cerebrum and brain stem. Laboratory results support that tissue alterations occurred as a result of BVDV type 2 infection. In the absence of other clinical signs related to BVDV infection and using the microscopic and laboratory evidence presented, we propose that the BVDV type 2 isolated from this case may represent a neurovirulent strain of the virus.

A panel of flavivirus-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was tested in blocking assays with serum samples from WNV-infected chickens and crows. Selected MAbs were further tested against serum samples from birds that represented 16 species and 10 families. Serum samples were collected from birds infected with WNV or Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and from noninfected control birds. Serum samples from SLEV-infected birds were included in these experiments because WNV and SLEV are closely related antigenically, are maintained in similar transmission cycles, and have overlapping geographic distributions. The ELISA that utilized MAb 3.1112G potentially discriminated between WNV and SLEV infections, as all serum samples from WNV-infected birds and none from SLEV-infected birds were positive in this assay. Assays with MAbs 2B2 and 6B6C-1 readily detected serum antibodies in all birds infected with WNV and SLEV, respectively, and in most birds infected with the other virus. Two other MAbs partially discriminated between infections with these two viruses. Serum samples from most WNV-infected birds but no SLEV-infected birds were positive with MAb 3.67G, while almost all serum samples from SLEV-infected birds but few from WNV-infected birds were positive with MAb 6B5A-5. The blocking assays reported here provide a rapid, reliable, and inexpensive diagnostic and surveillance technique to monitor WNV activity in multiple avian species."

However, PCV-2 is a ubiquitous virus in the swine population and a majority of pigs infected with PCV-2 do not develop the disease. Different factors such as age, maintenance, the genetics of PCV-2, other pathogens, etc. have been suggested to contribute to the development of PMWS. However, so far no proven connection between any of these factors and the disease development has been found. In this study we explored the possible presence of other so far unknown DNA containing infectious agents in lymph nodes collected from Swedish pigs with confirmed PMWS through random amplification and high-throughput sequencing. Although the vast majority of the amplified genetic sequences belonged to PCV-2, we also found genome sequences of Torque Teno virus (TTV) and of a novel parvovirus. The detection of TTV was expected since like PCV-2, TTV has been found to have high prevalence in pigs around the world. We were able to amplify a longer region of the parvovirus genome, consisting of the entire NP1 and partial VP1/2. By comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequences and phylogenetic studies we propose that this is a novel porcine parvovirus, with genetic relationship to bocaviruses."

This will help to understand how the microbiome influence the susceptibility of secondary agents and development of disease. We have applied viral metagenomics to investigate the virome of lymph nodes from Swedish pigs suffering from the multifactorial disease postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) as well as from healthy pigs. The aim is to increase knowledge of potential viruses, apart from porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), involved in PMWS development as well as to increase knowledge on the virome of healthy individuals. In healthy individuals, a diverse viral flora was seen with several different viruses present simultaneously. The majority of the identified viruses were small linear and circular DNA viruses, such as different circoviruses, anelloviruses and bocaviruses. In the pigs suffering from PMWS, PCV2 sequences were, as expected, detected to a high extent but other viruses were also identified in the background of PCV2. Apart from DNA viruses also RNA viruses were identified, among them were a porcine pestivirus showing high similarity to a recently (in 2015) discovered atypical porcine pestivirus in the US. Majority of the viruses identified in the background of PCV2 in PMWS pigs could also be identified in the healthy pigs. PCV2 sequences were also identified in the healthy pigs but to a much lower extent than in PMWS affected pigs. Although the method used here is not quantitative the very clear difference in amount of PCV2 sequences in PMWS affected pigs and healthy pigs most likely reflect the very strong replication of PCV2 known to be a hallmark of PMWS. Taken together, these findings illustrate that pigs appear to have a considerable viral flora consisting to a large extent of small single-stranded and circular DNA viruses. Future research on these types of viruses will help to better understand the role that these ubiquitous viruses may have on health and disease of pigs. We also demonstrate for the first time, in Europe, the presence of a novel porcine pestivirus."

Wild animals serve as reservoirs for many viruses, which may occasionally result in novel infections of domestic animals and/or the human population. Given this background, we used metagenomics to investigate the presence of viral pathogens in sera collected from bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus), a nocturnal species of wild Suid known to move between national parks and farmland, in Uganda. Application of 454 pyrosequencing demonstrated the presence of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV4), porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), a GB Hepatitis C-like virus, and a Sclerotinia hypovirulence-associated-like virus in sera from the bushpigs. PCR assays for each specific virus combined with Sanger sequencing revealed two TTSuV-1 variants, one TTSuV-2 variant as well as PPV4 in the serum samples and thereby confirming the findings from the 454 sequencing. Using a viral metagenomic approach we have made an initial analysis of viruses present in bushpig sera and demonstrated for the first time the presence of PPV4 in a wild African Suid. In addition we identified novel variants of TTSuV-1 and 2 in bushpigs."

It is generally believed that the interaction between different infectious agents plays an important role in regard to respiratory diseases. Therefore, we used high-throughput sequencing combined with viral metagenomics to characterise the viral community of tonsil samples from pigs coming from a conventional herd with lesions in the respiratory tract at slaughter. In parallel, samples from specific pathogen-free pigs were also analysed. This study showed a variable co-infection rate in the different pigs. The differences were not seen at the group level but in individual pigs. Some viruses such as adenoviruses and certain picornaviruses could be found in most pigs, while others such as different parvoviruses and anelloviruses were only identified in a few pigs. In addition, the complete coding region of porcine parvovirus 7 was obtained, as were the complete genomes of two teschoviruses. The results from this study will aid in elucidating which viruses are circulating in both healthy pigs and in pigs associated with respiratory illness. This knowledge is needed for future investigations into the role of viral-viral interactions in relation to disease development."

Phylogenetic analysis based on partial S1 gene sequences showed that five field viruses clustered together with 793/B-type strains, having 91.3-98.5% nucleotide identity within the group, and one isolate had very close sequence relationship (94.6% identity) with 624/I strain. These two IBV types have been identified in Italy previously. The other three variant isolates formed novel genotype detected recently in many countries of Western Europe. For one of these variant viruses, Italy-02, which afterwards became the prototype strain, the entire S1 gene was sequenced to confirm its originality. In contrast, phylogenetic analysis of more conserved partial N gene sequences, comprising 1-300 nucleotides, revealed different clustering. Thus, three variant IBVs of novel Italy-02 genotype, which had 96.7-99.2% S1 gene nucleotide identity with each other, belonged to three separate subgroups based on N gene sequences. 624/I-type isolate Italy-06 together with Italy-03, which was undetectable using S1 gene primers, shared 97.7% and 99.3% identity, respectively, in N gene region with vaccine strain H120. Only one of the 793/B-type isolates, Italy-10, clustered with the 793/B strain sharing 99.3% partial N gene identity, whereas the other four isolates were genetically distant from them (only 87.7-89.7% identity) and formed separate homogenous subgroup.

As to prion disease, the cellular prion protein is in its abnormal isoform(s) an essential component of prion protein aggregates found in affected tissue. In contrast to all neurodegenerative diseases like Morbus Alzheimer or Huntington's disease, prion diseases are transmissible. Therefore, prion diseases were designated Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE). The diseases have been well known for decades. Scrapie was first described around 1750, a BSE case was reported in the 1850-ties most likely a misdiagnosis, and in 1920/1930 the human Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) had been described. Transmission of CJD i. e. Kuru had been suspected in the early 1950 s and was erroneously classified as slow virus disease. The CJD transmission posed a problem to humans when transplants from CJD cases were used for treatment. Fortunately, these iatrogenic transmissions remained limited. But with the advent of BSE and appearance of variant CJD cases in the UK and some places in Europe scientists suspected that transmission from cattle to man could have happened. From animal models we know of successful transmission via several routes. Species barriers do not completely prevent transmission. Rather, transmission barriers might exist controlling individual susceptibility against prions. Modes of transmission, susceptibility to transmission, identification of receptor molecules as well as molecular mechanisms of the transmission process are being investigated with great intensity. Current knowledge leads us to assume that inapparent stages of prion infection wrongly suggest a (non-existent) species barrier. This inapparent infection precedes overt disease, and, hence, most research focuses on the development of highly sensitive assay systems for detection of minute amounts of pathological prion protein in suspected cases. Inapparence also should warn us to underestimate BSE or human vCJD cases; at present, approx. 145 cases occurred in Europe and one probable case in Hong Kong (June 2003). Whether BSE had spread to other parts of the world by animal nutrition components or meat can neither be excluded nor confirmed at this time. New data on transmission and consequences of BSE for the human population are summarised in this review."

In the present study we evaluated the viral diversity of fecal samples (nâ=â42) collected from 10 different species of wild small carnivores inhabiting the northern part of Spain using random PCR in combination with next-generation sequencing. Samples were collected from American mink (Neovison vison), European mink (Mustela lutreola), European polecat (Mustela putorius), European pine marten (Martes martes), stone marten (Martes foina), Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) and Eurasian badger (Meles meles) of the family of Mustelidae; common genet (Genetta genetta) of the family of Viverridae; red fox (Vulpes vulpes) of the family of Canidae and European wild cat (Felis silvestris) of the family of Felidae. A number of sequences of possible novel viruses or virus variants were detected, including a theilovirus, phleboviruses, an amdovirus, a kobuvirus and picobirnaviruses. Using random PCR in combination with next generation sequencing, sequences of various novel viruses or virus variants were detected in fecal samples collected from Spanish carnivores. Detected novel viruses highlight the viral diversity that is present in fecal material of wild carnivores."

Viral RNA was extracted from infected cell cultures, and BVDV-specific PCR primers were used to amplify > 1,000 bases of the viral genome. Derived sequences were used for molecular phylogenetic analyses to determine the viral genotype and viral genogroup and to assess genetic similarity among BVDVs. Analysis of the 17 NCP strains of BVDV failed to detect a viral genotype or viral genogroup not already reported to exist in the United States. One virus was classified as genotype 1, genogroup 1b, and 16 viruses were classified as genotype 2, genogroup 2a. Genotype 2 strains were genetically diverse, and genetic similarities were not obvious among viruses from geographic regions larger than a small locale. Viruses isolated from herds where a genotype 1, genogroup 1a BVDV vaccine was administered prior to breeding were primarily genetically diverse genotype 2, genogroup 2a BVDVs. Vaccination with multiple BVDV genotypes may be needed to improve protection.

Candidates for future vaccines are viruses that appear able to elude the immune response of cattle vaccinated against BVDV with existing vaccines."

          <jats:p>
            Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) were identified and characterized in three avian genomes to gain insight into early retroviral evolution. Using the computer program RetroTector to detect relatively intact ERVs, we identified 500 ERVs in the chicken genome, 150 in the turkey genome, and 1,200 in the zebra finch genome. Previous studies suggested that endogenous alpharetroviruses were present in chicken genomes. In this analysis, a small number of alpharetroviruses were seen in the chicken and turkey genomes; however, these were greatly outnumbered by beta-like, gamma-like, and alphabeta proviruses. While the avian ERVs belonged to the same major groups as mammalian ERVs, they were more heterogeneous. In particular, the beta-like viruses revealed an evolutionary continuum with the gradual acquisition and loss of betaretroviral markers and a transition from beta to alphabeta and then to alpharetroviruses. Thus, it appears that birds may resemble a melting pot for early ERV evolution. Many of the ERVs were integrated in clusters on chromosomes, often near centromeres. About 25% of the chicken ERVs were in or near cellular transcription units; this is nearly random. The majority of these integrations were in the sense orientation in introns. A higher-than-random number of integrations were &gt;100Â kb from the nearest gene. Deep-sequencing studies of chicken embryo fibroblasts revealed that about 20% of the 500 ERVs were transcribed and translated. A subset of these were also transcribed

In the P1 and P2 regions, turkey/M176/2011/HUN is related most closely to, but distinct from, the kobuviruses and turdivirus 1. Complete genome analysis revealed the presence of characteristic picornaviral amino acid motifs, a potential type II-like 5' UTR internal ribosome entry site (first identified among avian-origin picornaviruses) and a conserved, 48 nt long 'barbell-like' structure found at the 3' UTR of turkey/M176/2011/HUN and members of the picornavirus genera Avihepatovirus and Kobuvirus. The general presence of turkey picornavirus - a novel picornavirus species - in faecal samples from healthy and affected turkeys in Hungary and in the USA suggests the worldwide occurrence and endemic circulation of this virus in turkey farms.

            The comparative genome analysis of turkey and novel chicken megriviruses revealed numerous unique genome features, e.g., up to four potential 2A peptides, unusually long 3â² genome parts with various lengths containing a potential second open reading frame, multiple repeating sequence motifs, and heterogeneous sequence relationships (possibly due to a recombination event) between the structural and nonstructural genome regions. Our results could help us to better understand the evolution and diversity (in terms of sequence and genome layout) of picornaviruses.

The genome of GPV-1 shows an L-3-3-4 organization pattern with a 5'-terminal origin of replication (ORI) region, a type-IV IRES, and an Hbox/NC-type 2A protein.

The identified ChPBV segments are unrelated to each other and distant from all of the currently known PBVs. In silico sequence analyses revealed the presence of conserved prokaryotic Shine-Dalgarno-like (SD-like) sequences upstream of the three presumed open reading frames (ORFs) of the S1 and a single presumed ORF of the S2 segments. According to the results of expression analyses in E. coli using 6xHis-tagged recombinant ChPBV segment 1 construct and Western blot these SD-like sequences are functional in vivo suggesting that S1 of study PBVs can contain three ORFs and supporting the bacteriophage-nature of PBVs."

In studies on the antigenic conservation of these sites, the four antigenic/genetic groups of SVDV described showed distinguishable patterns, confirming this classification. By sequencing mAb-resistant mutants, the five sites have been mapped precisely and localized on a three-dimensional model of the SVDV capsid. All were found to be orientated, to a different extent, towards the external surface of the capsid. Three of the five sites, located in VP1, VP2 and VP3, correspond to epitopes identified previously in historic isolates as sites 1, 2a and 3b, respectively. Another site, site IV, which maps to position 258 of VP1, corresponds to an epitope reported recently and is described in this study to be specific for isolates of the most recent antigenic group of SVDV. A fifth site is described for the first time and corresponds to the unique neutralizing site that is common to both SVDV and coxsackie B5 virus; it maps to positions 95 and 98 of VP1, but may also include positions nearby that belong to site 1 on the BC-loop of VP1, suggesting the classification of site Ia. These results may have useful diagnostic and epidemiological applications, since mAbs to the new conserved site Ia provide universal reagents for SVDV detection systems, while the specificity of mAbs to site IV make them unique markers for the most recent strains of SVDV.</jats:p>"

While commercial vaccines against these viruses are available, the cost of implementing regular vaccination regimens against multiple diseases is prohibitive for most African farmers. A single, affordable multivalent vaccine that simultaneously protects against all 5 diseases would therefore be of significant benefit to the livestock sector in Africa. It could also serve as a platform for the development of new vaccines of significance to other developing countries around the world. In this paper, we present an overview of the economic importance of livestock in Africa, the pathogens responsible for RVF, PPR, SPP, GTP and LSD and the vaccination strategies currently used to combat them. We then review experience with the development of attenuated capripoxviruses as vaccines against LSD, SPP and GTP and of recombinant capripoxvirus-vectored vaccines against RVF and PPR. We conclude the article by presenting the rationale for a single, multivalent capripoxvirus-vectored vaccine that would protect against all 5 diseases of livestock, and describe the approach being taken by a consortium of Canadian and South African researchers to develop such a vaccine."

It has been divided into 4 major mammalian genotypes. In this study, 3 new full-length genomes of swine HEV were sequenced and the results did not reveal any particular host determinant in comparison with human isolates belonging to the same genotype. Nucleotide composition and codon usage bias were determined to characterize HEV host restriction and genome evolution. Peculiar nucleotide bias was observed for A and C nucleotides in all HEV genotypes. Apart from the ORF1 hypervariable region and the ORF2/3 overlapping region, no nucleotide bias was observed between the 3 codon positions. CpG dinucleotides were also shown to be under-represented in HEV as in most RNA viruses. The effective number of codon used in HEV genome was high, indicating a lack of codon bias. Correspondence analysis of the relative synonymous codon usage was performed and demonstrated that evolution of HEV is not driven by geographical or host factors, but is representative of HEV phylogeny. These results confirm that HEV genome evolution is mainly based on mutational pressure. Natural selection, for instance involving fine-tuning translation kinetics and escape from the host immune system, may also play a role in shaping the HEV genome, particularly in the ORF1 hypervariable region and the ORF2/3 overlapping region. These regions might be involved in host restriction. Finally this study revealed the need to re-evaluate the possible subtyping classification."

Twenty-nine percent of polymorphic sites found in HEV from the human sample were conserved throughout the infection of the heterologous host. The interspecies transmission of HEV quasispecies is the result of a genomic negative-selection pressure on random mutations which can be deleterious to the viral population. HEV intrahost nucleotide diversity was found to be in the lower range of other human RNA viruses but correlated with values found for zoonotic viruses. HEV transmission between humans and pigs does not seem to be modulated by host-specific mutations, suggesting that adaptation is mainly regulated by ecological drivers."

Many affected animals present with a nonsuppurative inflammatory reaction pattern in the brain. While this pattern supports a viral etiology, the causative pathogen remains unknown in a large proportion of cases. Using viral metagenomics, we identified an astrovirus (bovine astrovirus [BoAstV]-CH13) in the brain of a cow with nonsuppurative encephalitis. Additionally, BoAstV RNA was detected with reverse transcription-PCR and in situ hybridization in about one fourth (5/22 animals) of cattle with nonsuppurative encephalitis of unknown etiology. Viral RNA was found primarily in neurons and at the site of pathology. These findings support the notion that BoAstV infection is a common cause of encephalitis in cattle. Phylogenetically, BoAstV-CH13 was closely related to rare astrovirus isolates from encephalitis cases in animals and a human patient. Future research needs to be directed toward the pathogenic mechanisms, epidemiology, and potential cross-species transmission of these neurotropic astroviruses."

In this study, we mined Ion Torrent reads obtained by sequencing DNA isolated from archived blood samples collected from 100 performance tested Italian Large White pigs. Two reduced representation libraries were prepared from two DNA pools constructed each from 50 equimolar DNA samples. Bioinformatic analyses were carried out to mine unmapped reads on the reference pig genome that were obtained from the two NGS datasets. In silico analyses included read mapping and sequence assembly approaches for a viral metagenomic analysis using the NCBI Viral Genome Resource. Our approach identified sequences matching several viruses of the Parvoviridae family: porcine parvovirus 2 (PPV2), PPV4, PPV5 and PPV6 and porcine bocavirus 1-H18 isolate (PBoV1-H18). The presence of these viruses was confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing of individual DNA samples. PPV2, PPV4, PPV5, PPV6 and PBoV1-H18 were all identified in samples collected in 1998-2007, 1998-2000, 1997-2000, 1998-2004 and 2003, respectively. For most of these viruses (PPV4, PPV5, PPV6 and PBoV1-H18) previous studies reported their first occurrence much later (from 5 to more than 10 years) than our identification period and in different geographic areas. Our study provided a retrospective evaluation of apparently asymptomatic parvovirus infected pigs providing information that could be important to define occurrence and prevalence of different parvoviruses in South Europe. This study demonstrated the potential of mining NGS datasets non-originally derived by metagenomics experiments for viral metagenomics analyses in a livestock species."

Similar to Hendra virus (HeV), MenV appears to be a virus of fruit bats (flying foxes) in the genus Pteropus. No serological cross-reactivity was detected between MenV and other known paramyxoviruses and to facilitate virus classification a cDNA subtraction method was used to obtain viral-specific cDNA from MenV-infected cells. Cloning and sequencing of the products enabled the entire sequences of the NP, P/V, M, F, and HN genes to be determined. Comparison of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences for each gene with members of the family Paramyxoviridae, determination of the P gene mRNA editing strategy, and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that MenV is a new member of the genus Rubulavirus. However the deduced protein sequence of MenV HN exhibited only limited sequence homology when compared with attachment proteins of other paramyxoviruses. Key differences within the amino acid residues considered important determinants of neuraminidase activity suggest MenV HN is unlikely to possess the same degree of neuraminidase activity characteristic of other rubulavirus and respirovirus HN proteins."

Infection of guinea pigs with the New World arenavirus PichindÃ© virus (PICV) has been used as a biosafety level 2 model for the Lassa virus. Despite continuing research, little is known about the molecular basis of pathogenesis, and this has hindered the design of novel antiviral therapeutics. Modulation of the host response is a potential strategy for the treatment of infectious diseases. We have previously investigated the global host response to attenuated and lethal arenavirus infections by using high-throughput immunoblotting and kinomics approaches. In this report, we describe the differential nuclear proteomes of a murine cell line induced by mock infection and infection with attenuated and lethal variants of PICV, investigated by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Spot identification using tandem mass spectrometry revealed the involvement of a number of proteins that regulate inflammation via potential modulation of NF-kappaB activity and of several heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear proteins. Pathway analysis revealed a potential role for transcription factor XBP-1, a transcription factor involved in major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) expression; differential DNA-binding activity was revealed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and differences in surface MHC-II expression were seen following PICV infection. These data are consistent with the results of several previous studies and highlight potential differences between transcriptional and translational regulation. This study provides a number of differentially expressed targets for further research and suggests that key events in pathogenesis may be established early in infection."

It causes disease mainly in sheep and occasionally in cattle and other species. BTV has spread into northern Europe, causing disease in sheep and cattle. The introduction of new serotypes, changes in vector species, and climate change have contributed to these changes. Ten BTV serotypes have been isolated in Australia without apparent associated disease. Simplified methods for preferential isolation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and template preparation enabled high-throughput sequencing of the 10 genome segments of all Australian BTV prototype serotypes. Phylogenetic analysis reinforced the Western and Eastern topotypes previously characterized but revealed unique features of several Australian BTVs. Many of the Australian BTV genome segments (Seg-) were closely related, clustering together within the Eastern topotypes. A novel Australian topotype for Seg-5 (NS1) was identified, with taxa spread across several serotypes and over time. Seg-1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -7, -9, and -10 of BTV_2_AUS_2008 were most closely related to the cognate segments of viruses from Taiwan and Asia and not other Australian viruses, supporting the conclusion that BTV_2 entered Australia recently. The Australian BTV_15_AUS_1982 prototype was revealed to be unusual among the Australian BTV isolates, with Seg-3 and -8 distantly related to other BTV sequences from all serotypes."

This indicates that H1N1 viruses are evolving and that H1N1 soon is likely to be the prevalent strain again. Generally, the influenza A haemagglutinin (HA) of H3N2 viruses formed seasonal phylogenetic clusters. Different lineages co-circulating within the same season were also observed. The evolution has been stochastic, influenced by small ""jumps"" in genetic distance rather than constant drift, especially with the introduction of the Fujian-like viruses in 2002â2003. Also evolutionary stasis-periods were observed which might indicate well fit viruses. The evolution of H3N2 viruses have also been influenced by gene reassortments between lineages from different seasons. None of the influenza genes were influenced by strong positive selection pressure. The antigenic site B in H3N2 HA was the preferred site for genetic change during the study period probably because the site A has been masked by glycosylations. Substitutions at CTL-epitopes in the genes coding for the neuraminidase (NA), polymerase acidic protein (PA), matrix protein 1 (M1), non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and especially the nucleoprotein (NP) were observed.

Originally, the taxonomic classification of pestiviruses was based on the host species they were isolated from, but today, it is known that many pestiviruses exhibit a broad species tropism. This review provides an overview of BDV infection in cattle. The clinical, hematological and pathological-anatomical findings in bovines that were transiently or persistently infected with BDV largely resemble those in cattle infected with the closely related pestivirus bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV). Accordingly, the diagnosis of BDV infection can be challenging, as it must be differentiated from various pestiviruses in cattle. The latter is very relevant in countries with control programs to eradicate BVDV in Bovidae, as in most circumstances, pestivirus infections in sheep, which act as reservoir for BDV, are not included in the eradication scheme. Interspecies transmission of BDV between sheep and cattle occurs regularly, but BDV in cattle appears to be of minor general importance. Nevertheless, BDV outbreaks at farm or local level can be very costly."

However, the determination of the origin and composition of a stain is in most cases a prerequisite for the final elucidation of a criminal case. Standard methodologies, e.g. amplification of DNA followed by microsatellite typing or mitochondrial DNA sequencing, are often not sensitive enough to result in sufficient and conclusive data. We have applied ultra-deep DNA sequencing using the 454 pyrosequencing technology on a whole genome amplified (WGA) environmental biological stain, which was analysed unsuccessfully with standard methodologies following WGA. With the combination of WGA and 454 pyrosequencing, however, we were able to generate 7242 single sequences with an average length of 195bp. A total of 1,441,971bp DNA sequences were generated and compared with public DNA sequence databases. Using RepeatMasker and basic logical alignment search tool (BLAST) searches against known microbial and mammalian genomes it was possible to determine the metagenomic composition of the stain, i.e. 4.2% bacterial DNA, 0.3% viral DNA, 2.7% fungal DNA, 10.3% mammalian repetitive DNA, 0.9% porcine DNA, 0.13% human DNA and 81.5% DNA of unknown origin.

Sequencing of over 23 whole VZV genomes from around the world further refined the phylogenetic distinctions between SNP genotypes. Widespread surveillance in countries in which the varicella vaccine is now in use and the difficulties posed by three unique genotyping approaches prompted an international meeting, at which a common nomenclature based on phylogenetic clades was agreed upon.

Some lineages have different properties that may contribute to sporadic spread beyond their recognized endemic areas. The objective of this study was to review the most significant FMD epidemiological events that took place worldwide between 2007 and 2014. Severe epidemics were caused by FMD virus (FMDV) lineage O/Asia/Mya-98 in Japan and South Korea in 2010, both previously free of disease. In India, where FMD is endemic, the most important event was the re-emergence of lineage O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 in 2008. Notably, this lineage, normally restricted to India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, was also found in Saudi Arabia and Libya in 2013 and has caused several outbreaks in Tunisia and Algeria in 2014-2015. In January 2011, FMDV-positive wild boars were found in Bulgaria, where the disease last occurred in 1996, followed by 12 outbreaks in livestock infected with FMDV O/ME-SA/PanAsia2. In 2012, FMDV SAT2 caused outbreaks in Egypt and the Palestinian Autonomous Territories. Another significant event was the emergence of FMDV Asia1 Sindh-08 in the Middle East. In South America, one outbreak of FMDV serotype O, topotype Euro-SA was reported in Paraguay in 2011, which was recognized as FMD-free with vaccination at the time. Lessons learned from past events, point out the need for an integrated strategy that comprises coordinated global and regional efforts for FMDV control and surveillance. Specific local characteristics related to host, environment and virus that condition FMD occurrence should be carefully considered and incorporated to adapt appropriate strategies into local plans. In this review, we compiled relevant epidemiological FMD events to provide a global overview of the current situation. We further discussed current challenges present in different FMD areas."

Both proviral envelope (env) and long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences, separately and combined, were utilized in the following 2 sequence analysis methods: phylogenetic analysis and pairwise distance calculations. True maternal transmission events were defined as agreement in 2 out of the 2 sequence analysis methods. Using this criterion, proviral env sequences resulted in a 14.3% maternal transmission frequency, and proviral LTR sequences resulted in a 10% maternal transmission frequency. Both proportions of maternal transmission varied significantly from equality (P<0.0001). This indicates that the remaining 85.7-90% of daughters are infected via non-maternal transmission. This is also the first study to calculate the OPP proviral rate of change for the env gene and LTR promoter. Accurately defining the routes of OPPV transmission provides critical epidemiological data supporting management intended to reduce flock transmission and viral dose."

As the etiological agent of a significant emergent veterinary disease, several studies have attempted to explain its origin. However, several key questions remain, including the full biological ancestry of the virus, and its geographical and temporal origin. We sequenced near-complete genomes of 27 SVDV and 13 coxsackievirus B5 samples, all originally isolated between 1966 and 2006, and analysed these in conjunction with existing sequences and historical information. While analyses incorporating 24 additional near-complete SVDV genomic sequences indicate clear signs of within-SVDV recombination, all 51 SVDV isolates remain monophyletic. This supports a hypothesis of a single anthroponotic transfer origin. Analysis of individual coding and non-coding regions supports that SVDV has a recombinant origin between coxsackievirus B5 and another Enterovirus B serotype, most likely coxsackievirus A9. Extensive Bayesian sequence-based analysis of the time of the most recent common ancestor of all analysed sequences places this within a few years around 1961. Epidemiological evidence points to China as an origin, but there are no available samples to test this conclusively. Historical investigation and the clinical aspects of the involved Enterovirus B serotypes, makes the current results consistent with a hypothesis stating that SVDV originated through co-infection, recombination, and a single anthroponotic event, during large viral meningitis epidemics around 1960/1961 involving the ancestral serotypes. The exact geographical origin of SVDV may remain untestable due to historical aspects."

Analysis, for each agD clone, of the mean incubation time at 20 degrees C relative to the mean incubation time at 28 degrees C (t20,t28), compared to the range of similar data for wild-type virus enabled us to define 4 classes of agD mutant: (1) mutants equally affected at both temperatures, (2) cold-sensitive mutants in drosophila (csD), (3) heat-sensitive mutants in drosophila (tsD) and (4) mutants whose mean incubation time could not be estimated at either 20 or 28 degrees C. All agD mutants are listed. The majority of them were also ts in chicken embryo cells (CEC), and some were classified into complementation groups. Some correlations were noted. For example, the agD mutants that were ts+ in CEC were frequently (7 out of 12) weakly cold-sensitive in drosophila. Those tsD mutants which were also ts in CEC, all belonged to complementation group I (L protein). True csD mutants, whose divergence of incubation time with wt regularly increased, and which were also ts in CEC, all belonged to group I except for one which belonged to group V (G protein). Three mutants fell into a distinct sub-class of csD mutants, characterized by a defect in the CO2 sensitivity symptom expression below a definite temperature. One of these which was further characterized was shown to be in complementation group V. Some mutants of the fourth class were examined for their fly-invading capacity. This was found to be more-or-less strongly affected. Among these mutants, independent of this phenomenon, mutations were assigned to L, N and G proteins, suggesting that different physiological defects are involved. A comparison was made of the phenotypes in drosophila of some of the agD mutants with other members of the vesiculovirus family. The analogy of sigma rhabdovirus with tsD mutants is also reported."

          <jats:p>Full-genome sequencing of 11 Australian and 1 New Zealand avian influenza A virus isolate (all subtype H7) has enabled comparison of the sequences of each of the genome segments to those of other subtype H7 avian influenza A viruses. The inference of phylogenetic relationships for each segment has been used to develop a model of the natural history of these viruses in Australia. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin segment indicates that the Australian H7 isolates form a monophyletic clade. This pattern is consistent with the long-term, independent evolution that is, in this instance, associated with geographic regions. On the basis of the analysis of the other H7 hemagglutinin sequences, three other geographic regions for which similar monophyletic clades have been observed were confirmed. These regions are Eurasia plus Africa, North America, and South America. Analysis of the neuraminidase sequences from the H7N1, H7N3, and H7N7 genomes revealed the same region-based relationships. This pattern of independent evolution of Australian isolates is supported by the results of analysis of each of the six remaining genomic segments. These results, in conjunction with the occurrence of five different combinations of neuraminidase subtypes (H7N2, H7N3, H7N4, H7N6, H7N7) among the 11 Australian isolates, suggest that the maintenance host(s) is nearly exclusively associated with Australia. The single lineage of Australian H7 hemagglutinin sequences, despite the occurrence of multiple neuraminidase types, suggests the existence of a genetic pool from which a variety of reassortants arise rather than the presence of a small number of stable viral clones. This pattern of evolution is likely to occur in each of the regions mentioned above.</jats:p>"

Clinical signs and history included increased mortality, dyspnea, head tremors, recumbency, and somnolent or unaware birds. Postmortem examination of six recently dead birds showed red-tinged mucous in the choana and trachea and marked pulmonary edema. Histologic lesions in the brain included severe, multifocal lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalitis with foci of malacia, neuronal necrosis, and neuronophagia. All anatomic locations of the brain were affected, although histologic changes in the cerebellum were considered mild. Other histologic lesions included pulmonary congestion and edema, splenic congestion and lymphoid depletion, fibrinoid necrosis of vessels within the spleen, and multifocal pancreatic acinar necrosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was weakly positive for influenza A in the brain; IHC was negative in other tissues tested. The clinical and pathologic characteristics of this case matched previously published material concerning HPAI and add to instances of known or suspected mutation of a low pathogenic virus to a highly pathogenic virus."

During a 3-year period (from mid-2006 to mid-2009), 1374 birds from 16 different families were examined, and a total of 62 AIV were detected by means of a real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay. AIV were more frequently detected in Anatidae, Phoenicopteridae, Rallidae and Laridae families. Of the 62 positive samples, 28 AIV could be isolated in embryonated eggs. All isolates were subtyped by haemagglutinin and neuraminidase inhibition techniques and 10 different haemagglutinins (HA) and 7 neuraminidases (NA) were found in 13 different subtype combinations. The most common combinations were H4N6 (22.2%) and H1N1 (18.5%). The HA and NA gene sequences of different AIV subtypes were compared and aligned with those available AIV strains from genome databases. Our studies on AIV phylogenetic analysis revealed that all AIV genes sequenced from wild birds in North-Eastern Spain clustered within Eurasian avian clades, including the sequences of H8, N4 and N5 genes analyzed for the first time in Europe. The results contribute to the understanding of AIV in the Mediterranean area and in Europe."

Subsequent selective pressure analysis displayed specific traits of genes evolution in all 4 strains since their divergence from the recent common ancestor.

However, our knowledge of the changes that occur in miRNAs in host cells after JEV infection is still limited. To understand the molecular pathogenesis of JEV at the level of posttranscriptional regulation, we used Illumina deep sequencing to sequence two small RNA libraries prepared from PK-15 cells before and after JEV infection. We identified 522 and 427 miRNAs in the infected and uninfected cells, respectively. Overall, 132 miRNAs were expressed significantly differently after challenge with JEV: 78 were upregulated and 54 downregulated. The sequencing results for selected miRNAs were confirmed with RT-qPCR. GO analysis of the host target genes revealed that these dysregulated miRNAs are involved in complex cellular pathways, including the metabolic pathway, inflammatory response and immune response. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the comparative expression of miRNAs in PK-15 cells after JEV infection. Our findings will underpin further studies of miRNAsâ roles in JEV replication and identify potential candidates for antiviral therapies against JEV.</jats:p>"

In the present study, we evaluated pools of blood samples obtained from two phylogenetically distant bat families, in particular from flying foxes (Pteropodidae), Eidolon helvum in West Africa, and from two species of New World leaf-nosed fruit bats (Phyllostomidae), Artibeus jamaicensis and Artibeus lituratus in Central America. A sequence-independent virus discovery technique (VIDISCA) was used in combination with high throughput sequencing to detect two novel parvoviruses: a PARV4-like virus named Eh-BtPV-1 in Eidolon helvum from Ghana and the first member of a putative new genus in Artibeus jamaicensis from Panama (Aj-BtPV-1). Those viruses were circulating in the corresponding bat colony at rates of 7-8%. Aj-BtPV-1 was also found in Artibeus lituratus (5.5%). Both viruses were detected in the blood of infected animals at high concentrations: up to 10E8 and to 10E10 copies/ml for Aj-BtPV-1 and Eh-BtPV-1 respectively. Eh-BtPV-1 was additionally detected in all organs collected from bats (brain, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys and intestine) and spleen and kidneys were identified as the most likely sites where viral replication takes place. Our study shows that bat parvoviruses share common ancestors with known parvoviruses of humans and livestock. We also provide evidence that a variety of Parvovirinae are able to cause active infection in bats and that they are widely distributed in these animals with different geographic origin, ecologies and climatic ranges."

In South America, serological surveys in pigs indicate that IAVs of the H3 and H1 subtypes are currently in circulation; however, neither virus isolation nor characterization has been reported. In November 2008, an outbreak of respiratory disease in pigs consistent with swine influenza virus (SIV) infection was detected in Argentina. The current study describes the clinical epidemiology, pathology, and molecular and biological characteristics of the virus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus isolate shared nucleotide identities of 96-98â% with H3N2 IAVs that circulated in humans from 2000 to 2003. Antigenically, sera from experimentally inoculated animals cross-reacted mainly with non-contemporary human-origin H3N2 influenza viruses. In an experimental infection in a commercial swine breed, the virus was of low virulence but was transmitted efficiently to contact pigs and caused severe disease when an infected animal acquired a secondary bacterial infection. This is the first report of a wholly human H3N2 IAV associated with clinical disease in pigs in South America. These studies highlight the importance of two-way transmission of IAVs and SIVs between pigs and humans, and call for enhanced influenza surveillance in the pig population worldwide."

It affected industrially reared poultry, dealer flocks and backyard flocks, with a total of 254 outbreaks notified up to December 31, 2000. Virological investigations yielded virulent isolates of Newcastle disease virus, which produced intracerebral pathogenicity indices ranging from 1.6 to 2.0 and which, on the basis of their monoclonal antibody binding patterns, could be classified as belonging to group Cl. The clinical, gross and microscopical findings were typical of Newcastle disease, and different avian species were susceptible to different degrees. Chickens and guinea fowl appeared to be the most susceptible, followed by pheasants, turkeys and ostriches. The epidemiological inquiry highlighted the crucial role of a broiler hatchery in initiating the epidemic, and of dealers in perpetuating it. The control measures imposed by Directive 92/66/EEC are discussed with reference to the outbreaks in backyard flocks.</jats:p>"

The phylogenetic analysis of pol sequences permitted to classify these isolates as A4 subtype. None of the animals showed clinical signs of SRLV infection, confirming previous observations which had suggested that this particular subtype is highly attenuated, at least for goats. A quantitative real time PCR strategy based on primers and probes derived from a highly variable env region permitted us to classify the animals as uninfected, singly or doubly infected. The performance of different serological tools based on this classification revealed their profound inadequacy in monitoring animals infected with this particular SRLV subtype. In vitro, the isolates showed differences in their cytopathicity and a tendency to replicate more efficiently in goat than sheep cells, especially in goat macrophages. By contrast, in vivo, these viruses reached significantly higher viral loads in sheep than in goats. Both env subtypes infected goats and sheep with equal efficiency. One of these, however, reached significantly higher viral loads in both species. In conclusion, we characterized three isolates of the SRLV subtype A4 that efficiently circulate in a mixed herd of goats and sheep in spite of their apparent attenuation and a strict physical separation between goats and sheep. The poor performance of the serological tools applied indicates that, to support an SRLV eradication campaign, it is imperative to develop novel, subtype specific tools."

An unusual outbreak of skin disease in fattening calves in southern Brazil is described. Fourteen of 17 male cattle (82%), aged 6-48 months, feeding on grass pastures were affected. Animals developed papules, vesicles, and scabby proliferative lesions on the muzzle in a clinical course of approximately 10-15 days. The scabby lesions often presented with exudation and bleeding. Histological examination of mucocutaneous tissue in detached scabs revealed acanthosis with thickening of the corneal layer and premature keratinization (parakeratotic hyperkeratosis). The dermis had multifocal lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates. Electron microscopic examination of scab specimens revealed typical parapoxvirus particles: oval shaped (260 nm Ã 160 nm), enveloped, and covered with a helical layer. Polymerase chain reaction using a set of pan-parapoxvirus primers for the B2L gene amplified a 590-bp product out of DNA extracted from scabs. Nucleotide sequencing of the amplicons revealed a nucleotide homology of 97% with Pseudocowpox virus and lower homology with other parapoxviruses: Bovine papular stomatitis virus (84%) and Orf virus (94%). A phylogenetic tree based on the B2L sequence was constructed, showing that the virus clustered with Pseudocowpox virus isolates."

Sudden increase in mortality prompted the submission of 20 Japanese quail hens (Coturnix c. japonica) to the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory, Turlock Branch. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs tested positive for influenza A virus H5N8 by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The virus was subsequently isolated. In vivo assay and sequencing of the hemagglutinin protein cleavage site classified the virus as a North American genetic lineage of low pathogenicity for chickens. Following the diagnosis, a rapid and coordinated response took place to contain the outbreak. The affected premise was depopulated, cleaned, and disinfected. Three areas from the affected premises-a 3 kilometer (km) radius (High Risk Zone), a 3-10 km area (Buffer Zone), and a 10-20 km (Surveillance Zone)-were established for avian influenza testing of commercial and noncommercial poultry operations. Surveillance testing and rapid control measures were successful in the control and eradication of the outbreak and revealed no area of spread of the virus from the index flock.

It is one of the earliest described members of the genus Orthopoxvirus, which includes the viruses that cause smallpox and monkeypox in humans. Both the historic and current literature describe ""cowpox"" as a disease with a single etiologic agent. Genotypic data presented herein indicate that CPXV is not a single species, but a composite of several (up to 5) species that can infect cows, humans, and other animals. The practice of naming agents after the host in which the resultant disease manifests obfuscates the true taxonomic relationships of ""cowpox"" isolates. These data support the elevation of as many as four new species within the traditional ""cowpox"" group and suggest that both wild and modern vaccine strains of Vaccinia virus are most closely related to CPXV of continental Europe rather than the United Kingdom, the homeland of the vaccine."

A search for homologues of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein revealed that it is composed of thousands of intercalating and overlapping viral matches of pentapeptide or longer gapped consensi, belonging to over 70% of the currently sequenced virome, infecting all kingdoms from bacteria to man. It was also highly homologous to proteins from the Visna/Maedi and other ovine viruses, while other proteins (nef/tat/gag/pol) were homologous to proteins from the equine infectious anaemia virus and HTLV-2/HTLV-3 viruses. This phenomenon suggests that horizontal gene transfer from coinfecting RNA and DNA viruses to retroviruses is extensive, providing a route for the subsequent insertion of non-retroviral genes into human and other genomes via retroviral integration. This homology includes all viruses for which vaccines already exist. Cross-reactive immunity may be operative in AIDS, as Vaccinia vaccination decreases viral replication in HIV-1 infected patients' cells, for the CCR5 tropic form. Measles, Dengue virus, or GB virus C infections also decrease the HIV-1 viral load. A resumption of Vaccinia/smallpox vaccination might be expected to have a significant effect on the AIDS pandemic, and a careful study of the potential uses of other existing viral and bacterial vaccines merits close attention. This phenomenon may also be relevant to other recalcitrant viruses, bacteria, and parasites for which no vaccine exists and the armory of existing vaccines may have a role to play in diseases other than those for which they were designed."

The presence of viral RNA in human and swine samples was also evaluated, and phylogenetic analysis was performed on HEV-positive samples. Forty-two swine farms were sampled; 142 workers were enrolled in the study and classified into two groups: (i) 69 workers with occupational contact with swine (including veterinarians and farmers) recruited in the 42 sampled farms; (ii) 73 without occupational contact with swine. Forty-one of 42 (97%) swine farms resulted positive to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test for HEV antibodies (Abs). Overall seroprevalence in swine was 50% (441/879), with seropositivity rate higher in sows (333/469, 71%). HEV RNA in stool samples was detected in animals from 13 of 42 tested farms (31%), and a higher positivity resulted in weaners (40/246, 16.3%). Phylogenetic analysis classified all HEV isolates within genotype 3 (subtypes 3f, 3e, 3c). All humans were negative for HEV viral genome in blood. Five of 142 sera were positive for IgG anti-HEV with an overall prevalence of 3.52% with no statistically significant differences in prevalence rates between workers at zoonotic risk and the control group (5.7% versus 1.3%). In contrast, a significant difference (OR 10.1) was observed within the subgroup including subjects exposed for short periods (veterinarians) compared with those who worked for long periods (farmers) suggesting a correlation between the time of exposure and the likelihood of HEV infection. Reporting HEV infection is not mandatory in Italy, but a constant epidemiological surveillance should be ensured to clarify the epidemiology of this disease."

Specifically, divergences in the nucleotide sequence of the L1 gene are useful for the identification and classification of new papillomavirus types. On the present work, a method based on the PCR-RFLP technique and DNA sequencing was evaluated as a screening tool, allowing for the detection of two relatively rare types of BPV in lesions samples from a six-year-old Holstein dairy cow, chronically affected with cutaneous papillomatosis. These findings point to the dissemination of BPVs with unclear pathogenic potential, since two relatively rare, new described BPV types, which were first characterized in Japan, were also detected in Brazil."

BEFV is endemic in tropical and sub-tropical regions including Thailand, a country in mainland Southeast Asia. However, there are few studies on BEFV and no available information regarding molecular characteristics of BEFV in Thailand. Therefore, the aims of this study were to genetically characterize Thai BEFVs and reveal their evolutions by phylogenetic analysis of G gene ectodomain sequences. From 2013 to 2017, blood samples were collected from bovine that matched with BEF case definition from three regions of Thailand. Thai BEFV G genes and a whole genome of an isolate, East Asia/TH/LRI0045/2016, were sequenced and characterized. Additionally, their phylogenies were constructed. This is the first report on genetics of BEFV in Southeast Asia. G ectodomain encoding region of Thai BEFV found during 2013-2017 are closely related to the second and third sub-clades of East Asia lineage. In addition, we observed mutation in the putative P' ORF of all Thai BEFVs which generated a premature stop codon. Thai G gene sequences are closely related to those of mainland Chinese and Taiwanese isolates. The whole genomic sequences of Thai BEFV and East Asia/China/JT02âL/2002 possess common characteristics, suggesting shared evolutionary relationship between East and Southeast Asian strains. Further studies on relationship between animal translocation, circulation of BEFV in Greater Mekong subregion and acquisition of more G gene sequences may improve understanding of BEFV epidemiology in mainland Southeast Asia."

Ceftiofur, the most widely used antibiotic used in U.S. dairy cows, is a 3rd generation cephalosporin, a critically important class of antibiotics to human health. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of typical ceftiofur antibiotic treatment on the prevalence of ARGs in the fecal microbiome of dairy cows using a metagenomics approach. Î²-lactam ARGs were found to be elevated in feces from Holstein cows administered ceftiofur (n = 3) relative to control cows (n = 3). However, total numbers of ARGs across all classes were not measurably affected by ceftiofur treatment, likely because of dominance of unaffected tetracycline ARGs in the metagenomics libraries. Functional analysis via MG-RAST further revealed that ceftiofur treatment resulted in increases in gene sequences associated with ""phages, prophages, transposable elements, and plasmids"", suggesting that this treatment also enriched the ability to horizontally transfer ARGs. Additional functional shifts were noted with ceftiofur treatment (e.g., increase in genes associated with stress, chemotaxis, and resistance to toxic compounds; decrease in genes associated with metabolism of aromatic compounds and cell division and cell cycle), along with measureable taxonomic shifts (increase in Bacterioidia and decrease in Actinobacteria). This study demonstrates that ceftiofur has a broad, measureable and immediate effect on the cow fecal metagenome. Given the importance of 3rd generation cephalospirins to human medicine, their continued use in dairy cattle should be carefully considered and waste treatment strategies to slow ARG dissemination from dairy cattle manure should be explored."

The intrusions of human into natural habitats of wild birds, the domestication of wild birds as pets or racing birds, and the increasing poultry consumption by human have facilitated avian viruses to cross species barriers to cause zoonosis. Recently, a novel adenovirus was exclusively found in birds causing an outbreak of Chlamydophila psittaci infection among birds and humans. Instead of being the primary cause of an outbreak by jumping directly from bird to human, a novel avian virus can be an augmenter of another zoonotic agent causing the outbreak. A comprehensive avian virome will improve our understanding of birds' evolutionary dynamics."

Of the many detectably homologous segments present in PV genomes, a 291-bp segment of the L1 gene is notable because it is flanked by the MY09 and MY11 consensus primers and contains highly conserved amino acid residues which simplify sequence alignment. We determined the MY09-MY11 sequences of human PV type 20 (HPV-20), HPV-21, HPV-22, HPV-23, HPV-24, HPV-36, HPV-37, HPV-38, HPV-48, HPV-50, HPV-60, HPV-70, HPV-72, HPV-73, ovine (sheep) PV, bovine PV type 3 (BPV-3), BPV-5, and BPV-6 and created a database which now encompasses HPV-1 to HPV-70, HPV-72, HPV-73, seven yet untyped HPV genomes, and 15 animal PV types. Three additional animal PVs were analyzed on the basis of other sequence data. We constructed phylogenies based on partial L1 and E6 gene sequences and distinguished five major clades that we call supergroups. One of them unites 54 genital PV types, which can be further divided into eleven groups. The second supergroup has 24 types and unites most PVs that are typically found in epidermodysplasia verruciformis patients but also includes several types typical of other cutaneous lesions, like HPV-4. The third supergroup unites the six known ungulate fibropapillomaviruses, the fourth includes the cutaneous ungulate PVs BPV-3, BPV-4, and BPV-6, and the fifth includes HPV-1, HPV-41, HPV-63, the canine oral PV, and the cottontail rabbit PV.

Genomes of the two vaccine ILTV strains were sequenced using Illumina Genome Analyzer 2X of 36 cycles of single-end reads. Results revealed that few nucleotide differences (23 in vaccine 1; 31 in vaccine 2) were found and indicate that the US CEO strains are practically identical to the Australian Serva CEO strain, which is a European-origin vaccine. The sequence differences demonstrated the spectrum of variability among vaccine strains. Only eight amino acid differences were found in ILTV proteins including UL54, UL27, UL28, UL20, UL1, ICP4, and US8 in vaccine 1. Similarly, in vaccine 2, eight amino acid differences were found in UL54, UL27, UL28, UL36, UL1, ICP4, US10, and US8. Further comparison of US CEO vaccines to several ILTV genome sequences revealed that US CEO vaccines are genetically close to both the Serva vaccine and 63140/C/08/BR (GenBank accession: HM188407) and are distinct from the two Australian-origin CEO vaccines, SA2 (GenBank accession: JN596962) and A20 (GenBank accession: JN596963), which showed close similarity to each other. These data demonstrate the potential of high-throughput sequencing technology to yield insight into the sequence variation of different ILTV strains. This information can be used to discriminate between vaccine ILTV strains and further, to identify newly emerging mutant strains of field isolates."

This study analyzed surveillance results, epidemiologic characteristics, and viral sequences by using government-released information, with the intention to provide recommendations to minimize future pandemic influenza. The H5 clade 2.3.4.4 highly pathogenic AI viruses (HPAIVs) had not been detected in Taiwan before 2015. During this epidemic, four types of etiologic agents were identified: the three novel subtypes H5N2, H5N8, and H5N3 clade 2.3.4.4 HPAIVs and one endemic chicken H5N2 subtype (Mexican-like lineage) of low pathogenic AI viruses. Cocirculation of mixed subtypes also occurred, with H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 HPAIVs accompanied by the H5N8 and H5N3 subtypes or old H5N2 viruses in the same farm. More than 90% of domestic geese died from this AI epidemic; geese were affected the most at the early outbreaks. The epidemic peaked in mid-January for all three novel H5 subtypes. Spatial epidemiology found that most affected areas were located in southwestern coastal areas. In terrestrial poultry (mostly chickens), different geographic distributions of AI virus subtypes were detected, with hot spots of H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 vs. past-endemic old H5N2 viruses in Changhwa (P = 0.03) and Yunlin (P = 0.007) counties, respectively, of central Taiwan. Phylogenetic and sequence analyses of all the early 10 Taiwan H5 clade 2.3.4.4 isolates covering the three subtypes showed that they were very different from the HA of the past local H5 viruses from domestic ducks (75%-80%) and chickens (70%-75%). However, they had the highest sequence identity percentages (99.53%-100%), with the HA of A/crane/Kagoshima/KU13/2014(H5N8) isolated on December 7, 2014, in Japan being higher than those of recent American and Korean H5 HPAIVs [A/Northern pintail/Washington/40964/2014 (H5N2) and A/gyrfalcon/Washington/41088-6/2014 (H5N8): 99.02%-99.54% and A/Baikal teal/Korea/Donglim3/2014 (H5N8): 98.61%-99.08%], implying a likely common ancestor of these H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses. The multiple subtypes of H5 clade 2.3.4.4 HPAIVs imply high viral reassortment. We recommend establishing an integrated surveillance system, involving clinical, virologic, and serologic surveillance in poultry and wild birds, swine and other mammals prevalent on multiple-animal mixed-type traditional farms, and high-risk human populations, as a crucially important step to minimize future pandemic influenza."

Ninety fecal samples from calves with diarrhea, 81 samples from adult cows with diarrhea (winter dysentery), and 20 fecal samples from healthy adult cows were tested for group C rotaviruses by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immune electron microscopy, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Three samples from adult cow diarrhea cases were positive only by RT-PCR, and a group C rotavirus was isolated from a positive sample in monkey kidney (MA104) cells (WD534tc/C). Genetically and serologically, the WD534tc/C strain was more closely related to the Cowden porcine group C strain than to the Shintoku bovine strain. Because the original cow feces also contained a group A rotavirus (detected after passage in cell culture), we hypothesized that such dual-rotavirus infections might play a role in the pathogenesis and host adaptation of rotaviruses. Thus, we examined the pathogenesis of WD534tc/C alone or combined with virulent (IND/A) or attenuated (NCDV/A) bovine group A rotaviruses in gnotobiotic calves. WD534tc/C alone induced diarrhea without (or with limited) virus shedding in inoculated calves (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 3). In contrast, all calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 2) developed diarrhea and shed both viruses, whereas calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and NCDV/A (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 3) developed diarrhea but did not shed either virus. Infection with WD534tc/C or NCDV/A alone caused only mild villous atrophy (jejunum and/or ileum), whereas dual infection with both viruses induced lesions throughout the small intestine. Although IND/A alone caused villous atrophy, more-widespread small intestinal lesions occurred in calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A. In conclusion, coinfection of calves with group A rotaviruses enhanced fecal shedding of a bovine group C rotavirus and the extent of histopathological lesions in the small intestines. Thus, our findings suggest a potential novel hypothesis involving dual infections for the adaptation of heterologous rotaviruses to new host species.</jats:p>"

            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Clostridium difficile</jats:named-content>
            infections. However, concerns persist about unwanted cotransfer of pathogenic microbes such as viruses. Here we studed FMT from a single healthy human donor to three pediatric ulcerative colitis patients, each of whom received a course of 22 to 30 FMT treatments. Viral particles were purified from donor and recipient stool samples and sequenced; the reads were then assembled into contigs corresponding to viral genomes or partial genomes. Transfer of selected viruses was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Viral contigs present in the donor could be readily detected in recipients, with up to 32 different donor viral contigs appearing in a recipient sample. Reassuringly, none of these were viruses are known to replicate on human cells. Instead, viral contigs either scored as bacteriophage or could not be attributed taxonomically, suggestive of unstudied phage. The two most frequently transferred gene types were associated with temperate-phage replication. In addition, members of
            <jats:italic>Siphoviridae</jats:italic>
            , the group of typically temperate phages that includes phage lambda, were found to be transferred with significantly greater efficiency than other groups. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the temperate-phage replication style may promote efficient phage transfer between human individuals. In summary, we documented transfer of multiple viral lineages between human individuals through FMT, but in this case series, none were from viral groups known to infect human cells.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Transfer of whole communities of viruses between humans has rarely been studied but is of likely medical importance. Here we studied fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), a highly successful treatment for relapsing
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Clostridium difficile</jats:named-content>
            infection and, potentially, other gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. We investigated the transfer of viral communities during FMT and documented transfer of multiple viral lineages between humans. None of these were viruses that replicated on animal cells or that are known to be pathogenic. We found that temperate bacteriophage, which form stable associations with their hosts, were significantly more likely to be transferred during FMT. This supports a model in which the viral temperate replication style may have evolved in part to support efficient viral transmission between environments.

            Bacterial pathogens impose a heavy health burden worldwide. In the new era of high-throughput sequencing and online bioinformatics, real-time genome typing of infecting agents, and in particular those with potential severe clinical outcomes, holds promise for guiding clinical care to limit the detrimental effects of infections and to prevent potential local or global outbreaks. Here, we sequenced and compared 85 isolates of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Streptococcus suis</jats:named-content>
            , a zoonotic human and swine pathogen, wherein we analyzed 32 recognized serotypes and 75 sequence types representing the diversity of the species and the human clinical isolates with high public health significance. We found that 1,077 of the 2,469 genes are shared by all isolates. Excluding 201 common but mobile genes, 876 genes were defined as the minimum core genome (MCG) of the species. Of 190,894 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified, 58,501 were located in the MCG genes and were referred to as MCG SNPs. A population structure analysis of these MCG SNPs classified the 85 isolates into seven MCG groups, of which MCG group 1 includes all isolates from human infections and outbreaks. Our MCG typing system for
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">S. suis</jats:named-content>
            provided a clear separation of groups containing human-associated isolates from those containing animal-associated isolates. It also separated the group containing outbreak isolates, including those causing life-threatening streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome, from sporadic or less severe meningitis or bacteremia-only isolates. The typing system facilitates the application of genome data to the fields of clinical medicine and epidemiology and to the surveillance of

Choleraesuis), causing paratyphoid in pigs and bacteremia in humans, commonly carry a virulence plasmid and sometimes a separate antimicrobial-resistant plasmid or merging together. This study aimed to analyze the likely mechanism of how to form a virulence-resistance chimera of plasmid in S. Choleraesuis. Whole plasmid sequence of pOU7519 in S. Choleraesuis strain OU7519 was determined using shotgun cloning and sequencing. Sequence annotation and comparison were performed to determine the sequence responsible for the formation of a chimeric virulence-resistance pOU7519. Other chimeric plasmids among the collected strains of S. Choleraesuis were also confirmed. The sequence of pOU719, 127,212Â bp long, was identified to be a chimera of the virulence plasmid pSCV50 and a multidrug-resistant plasmid pSC138 that have been found in S.Â Choleraesuis strain SC-B67. The pOU7519 is a conjugative plasmid carrying various mobile DNAs, including prophages, insertion sequences, integrons and transposons, especially a Tn6088-like transposon. By dissecting the junction site of the pSCV50-pSC138 chimera in pOU7519, defective sequences at integrase gene scv50 (int) and its attachment site (att) were found, and that likely resulted in a stable chimera plasmid due to the failure of excision from the pSCV50-pSC138 chimera. Similar structure of chimera was also found in other large plasmids. The deletion of both the int and att sties could likely block chimera excision, and result in an irreversible, stable pSCV50-pSC138 chimera. The emergence of conjugative virulence and antimicrobial-resistant plasmids in S. Choleraesuis could pose a threat to health public."

Phylogenetic trees based on DNA pol sequences and hybridization of total genomic DNA showed similar branching patterns.

The phylogenetic tree inferred from the deduced amino acid sequences of DNA pol from 24 dsDNA viruses, including phycodnaviruses, herpesviruses, poxviruses, baculoviruses, and African swine fever virus corresponded well with groupings based on the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Microalgal viruses are more closely related to each other than to the other dsDNA viruses and form a distinct phyletic group, suggesting that they share a common ancestor and belong to the Phycodnaviridae.

The novel duck-specific CoV was a potential novel species within the genus Gammacoronavirus, as indicated by sequences of three regions in the viral 1b gene.

A total of 102 CoV positives were identified through the survey. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral N sequences suggested that CoVs in domestic fowls have diverged into several region-specific or host-specific clades or subclades in the world, and IBVs can infect ducks, geese and pigeons, although they mainly circulate in chickens. Moreover, this study provided novel data supporting the notion that some host-specific CoVs other than IBVs circulate in ducks, geese and pigeons, and indicated that the novel duck-specific CoV identified through RNA-Seq in this study is genetically closer to some CoVs circulating in wild water fowls. Taken together, this study shed new insight into the diversity, distribution, evolution and control of avian CoVs."

Assembly results of high-throughput sequencing showed that the structures of both P483 and P694 genomes consist of linear and double-stranded DNA. Results of the electron microscopy and homology analysis revealed that both P483 and P694 belong to T7-like virus which is a member of the Podoviridae family of the Caudovirales order. Comparative genomic analysis showed that most of the predicted proteins of these two phages showed strongest sequence similarity to the Enterobacteria phages BA14 and 285P, Erwinia phage FE44, and Kluyvera phage Kvp1; however, some proteins such as gp0.6a, gp1.7 and gp17 showed lower similarity (<85%) with the homologs of other phages in the T7 subgroup. We also found some unique characteristics of P483 and P694, such as the two types of the genes of P694 and no lytic activity of P694 against its host bacteria in liquid medium. Our results serve to further our understanding of phage evolution of T7-like coliphages and provide the potential application of the phages as therapeutic agents for the treatment of diseases."

However, the virome of PEDV infected pigs and its effect on disease severity remains unknown. The advancements of sequencing technology have made it possible to characterize the entire microbiome of different body sites for any host. The objective of this study was to characterize the RNA virome in PEDV-positive pigs using the hypothesis-free metagenomics approach based on next-generation sequencing. Specifically, 217 PEDV-positive swine fecal swab samples collected from diarrheic piglets over 17 US states during 2015-2016 were analyzed. A Kraken algorithm-based bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of up to 9 different RNA genera besides PEDV (Alphacoronavirus genus), including Mamastrovirus (52%, 113/217), Enterovirus (39%, 85/217), Sapelovirus (31%, 67/217), Posavirus (30%, 66/217), Kobuvirus (23%, 49/217), Sapovirus (13%, 28/217), Teschovirus (10%, 22/217), Pasivirus (9%, 20/217), and Deltacoronavirus (3%, 6/217). There were 58 out of 217 piglets (27%) have PEDV infection alone whereas the remaining 159 (73%) shed 2 up to 9 different viruses. These findings demonstrated that PEDV infected diarrheic pigs had an extensive RNA viral flora consisting of four different families: Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, and Coronaviridae."

Diarrhoea is a common disease in yaks, resulting in major economic losses. To investigate the diversity of viral species, we reported the metagenomics-derived virome in a pooled faecal sample of 20 diarrhoeic yaks. The nine viruses found in the pooled diarrhoeic samples, in order of abundance of nucleic acid sequence, were influenza A virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), rotavirus, ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 (bovine hokovirus), astrovirus (AstV), bovine enterovirus, hepatitis E virus, kobuvirus and woodchuck hepatitis virus. Compared with healthy yaks, only AstV had a significantly higher prevalence rate in diarrhoeal samples, indicating a correlation with the clinical symptoms of diarrhoea in yaks. To further investigate the molecular characterization of yak AstV, a near-full genome was obtained from a diarrhoeic sample. It was 6243 bp in length and shared 46.4â66.2 % similarity with other related bovine AstVs from faeces. Phylogenetic analysis of the genome demonstrated that the yak AstV fell within the bovine AstVs cluster, but was located in a unique lineage, suggesting a novel AstV species was identified in yaks. Interestingly, the ORF2 region of yak AstV had closer similarity and genetically relationship with deer AstV strain CcAstV-2 than that of the bovine AstVs. Further analysis showed that one possible interspecies recombination event occurred in ORF2. In summary, this study expanded our understanding of the viral communities of diarrhoeal yaks and identified a novel AstV that was associated with diarrhoea in yaks."

RIG-I is absent in the chicken genome, but is conserved in the genome of ducks. Lack of RIG-I renders chickens more susceptible to avian influenza infection, and the clinical symptoms are more prominent than in other poultry. It is unknown whether introduction of duck RIG-I into chicken cells can establish the immunity as is seen in ducks and the role of RIG-I in established immunity is unknown. In this study, a chicken cell strain with stable expression of duRIG-I was established by lentiviral infection, giving DF1/LV5-RIG-I, and a control strain DF1/LV5 was established in parallel. To verify stable, high level expression of duRIG-I in DF1 cells, the levels of duRIG-I mRNA and protein were determined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Further, 5'triphosphate double stranded RNA (5'ppp-dsRNA) was used to mimic an RNA virus infection and the infected DF1/LV5-RIG-I and DF1/LV5 cells were subjected to high-throughput RNA-sequencing, which yielded 193.46Â M reads and 39.07Â G bases. A total of 278 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), i.e., duRIG-I-mediated responsive genes, were identified by RNA-seq. Among the 278 genes, 120 DEGs are annotated in the KEGG database, and the most reliable KEGG pathways are likely to be the signaling pathways of RIG-I like receptors. Functional analysis by Gene ontology (GO) indicates that the functions of these DEGs are primarily related to Type I interferon (IFN) signaling, IFN-Î²-mediated cellular responses and up-regulation of the RIG-I signaling pathway. Based on the shared genes among different pathways, a network representing crosstalk between RIG-I and other signaling pathways was constructed using Cytoscape software. The network suggests that RIG-mediated pathway may crosstalk with the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and MAPK signaling pathway during the transduction of antiviral signals. After screening, a group of key responsive genes in RIG-I-mediated signaling pathways, such as ISG12-2, Mx1, IFIT5, TRIM25, USP18, STAT1, STAT2, IRF1, IRF7 and IRF8, were tested for differential expression by real-time RT-PCR. In summary, by combining our results and the current literature, we propose a RIG-I-mediated signaling network in chickens."

High-throughput sequencing revealed that vB_BbrM_PHB04 has a linear double-stranded DNA genome with 124 putative open reading frames. Overall, the genome of vB_BbrM_PHB04 showed very low similarity (the highest nucleotide identity 82%, 1% coverage) to other phage sequences in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that vB_BbrM_PHB04 is a new member of the family Myoviridae. In addition, polymerase chain reaction-based detection of phage genes in phage-resistant B. bronchiseptica variants revealed no evidence of lysogenic activity of phage vB_BbrM_PHB04."

Genome sequences of sixty-six PRRSV strains were obtained using metagenomic sequencing of serum samples collected in the U.S. in 2014 to explore contemporary genetic diversity. Phylogenetic analysis of the genes encoding the envelope proteins identified four to eight distinct lineages with >87% intraclade identity. To explore the effect of the observed genetic diversity on antigenicity, the genome regions encoding either GP2a-GP3-GP4 or GP5-M in strain SD95-21 were replaced with alleles from each of eight distinct PRRSV strains using reverse genetics. The GP2a-GP3-GP4 region from only four of the eight strains yielded viable recombinant virus. When viable, both GP2a-GP3-GP4 and GP5-M variably affected antigenicity. A strain-dependent significant loss in cross reactivity was variably observed by indirect immunofluorescence assays using antisera from pigs vaccinated with commercial modified-live vaccines following replacement of GP2a-GP3-GP4 or GP5-M. Significantly reduced neutralization titers were similarly measured using antisera from naturally PRRSV-exposed pigs. These results illustrate the need to consider genomic regions besides GP5 for PRRSV epidemiology and vaccination."

Our previous work shows orf to be ubiquitous in the Fujian Province of China, a region where there is considerable heterogeneity among ORFVs. In this study, we sequenced full genomes of four Fujian goat ORFV strains (OV-GO, OV-YX, OV-NP, and OV-SJ1). The four strains were 132-139 kb in length, with each containing 124-132 genes and about 64% G+C content. The most notable differences between the four strains were found near the genome termini. OV-NP lacked seven and OV-SJ1 lacked three genes near the right terminus when compared against other ORFVs. We also investigated the skin-virulence of the four Fujian ORFVs in goats. The ORFVs with gene deletions showed low virulence while the ORFVs without gene deletions showed high virulence in goats suggesting gene deletion possibly leads to attenuation of ORFVs. Gene 134 was disrupted in OV-NP genome due to the lack of initial code. The phylogenetic tree based on complete Parapoxviruse genomes showed that sheep originated and goat originated ORFVs formed distinctly separate branches with 100% bootstrap. Based on the single gene phylogenetic tree of 132 genes of ORFVs, 47 genes can be easily distinguished as having originated from sheep or goats. In order to further reveal genetic variation presented in goat ORFVs and sheep ORFVs, we analyzed the deduced amino acid sequences of gene 008, multiple alignment of amino acid sequences of gene 008 from the genome of five goat ORFVs and four sheep ORFVs revealed 33 unique amino acids differentiating it as having sheep or goats as host. The availability of genomic sequences of four Fujian goat ORFVs aids in our understanding of the diversity of orf virus isolates in this region and can assist in distinguishing between orf strains that originate in sheep and goats."

The disease was diagnosed as an orf virus (ORFV XD strain) infection associating with Streptococcus pluranimalium and Staphylococcus, identified using standard virological and bacteriological techniques. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses of the whole ORFV 011 (B2L), 059 (F1L), 032 and 080 genes revealed that the even though the virus phylogeny was clustered in branches of conventional orf virus strains, it nonetheless evidenced high variation within this subset. Furthermore, the sequences from the ORFV 080 gene allowed us to distinguish between the different strains at a higher resolution and these observations afforded us a comparative view of the ORFV 080 gene. This is the first report describing an outbreak of severe multifocal cutaneous orf virus with associated bacterial infection in China."

The sequences were compared to other GenBank sequences using phylogenic and phylogeographic approaches. Our results show high sequence variability in Brazil, since, in this work, the Brazilian isolates were classified into subgroup 1AB, 2D and 2, which reveals that the virus was introduced in Brazil more than once. On the other hand, most of Brazilian isolates seem to be derived from only one introduction. According to the data from the Pig Breeders' Association, the multiple introductions of the virus probably occurred through the import of animals with the asymptomatic form of the virus or through the import of contaminated semen. The results point to the necessity of implementing programs aimed at selecting sows in order to avoid the import of animals infected by Group 1 PCV2."

To identify novel viruses in human stool specimens from patients with diarrhea and to investigate the ecology and clinical significance of such viruses. Nucleic acid extracted from stool specimens from patients with diarrhea with no known etiology were subjected to random PCR amplification and Roche/454 pyrosequencing. Novel viruses identified were genetically and epidemiologically characterized. Four gyroviruses, chicken anemia virus (CAV), human gyrovirus (HGV)/avian gyrovirus 2 (AGV2), gyrovirus 3 (GyV3) and a novel gyrovirus (tentatively designated as gyrovirus 4 (GyV4)) were identified in human stool specimens. GyV4, as well as CAV and AGV2/HGV were also detected in chicken skin and meat used for human consumption. A novel gyrovirus (GyV4) was identified in human stool and in chicken meat sold for human consumption. This virus was phylogenetically distinct from previously reported gyroviruses in chicken and humans (chicken anemia virus, human gyrovirus, avian gyrovirus 2 and recently reported gyrovirus 3). The epidemiology and pathogenesis of this virus in humans and in chicken needs to be further investigated."

The virus is classified into G and P serotypes and further into P genotypes based on differences in the surface-exposed proteins VP7 and VP4, respectively. Infection results in a variable level of protection from subsequent reinfection and disease. This protection is predominantly homotypic in some settings, whereas broader heterotypic protection is reported in other cohorts. Two antigenically distinct oral RV vaccines are licensed and are being rolled out widely, including in resource-poor setting, with funding provided by the GAVI alliance. First is a monovalent vaccine derived from a live-attenuated human RV strain, whereas the second is a pentavalent bovine-human reassortment vaccine. Both vaccines are highly efficacious in high-income settings, but greatly reduced levels of protection are reported in low-income countries. Here, the current challenges facing mucosal immunologists and vaccinologists aiming to define immunological correlates and to understand the variable levels of protection conferred by these vaccines in humans is considered.

Evidence for the occurrence of genome segment reassortment between viruses in the field was obtained from analyzing the species 11 RNAs from these five isolates.

These viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes when a female imbibes an infected blood-meal from a viremic vertebrate host and expectorates the virus into a subsequent host. Bamaga virus (BgV) is a flavivirus recently discovered in Culex sitiens subgroup mosquitoes collected from Cape York Peninsula, Australia. This virus phylogenetically clusters with the YFV group, but is potentially restricted in most vertebrates. However, high levels of replication in an opossum cell line (OK) indicate a potential association with marsupials. To ascertain whether BgV could be horizontally transmitted by mosquitoes, the vector competence of two members of the Cx. sitiens subgroup, Cx. annulirostris and Cx. sitiens, for BgV was investigated. Eleven to thirteen days after imbibing an infectious blood-meal, infection rates were 11.3% and 18.8% for Cx. annulirostris and Cx. sitiens, respectively. Cx. annulirostris transmitted the virus at low levels (5.6% had BgV-positive saliva overall); Cx. sitiens did not transmit the virus. When mosquitoes were injected intrathoracially with BgV, the infection and transmission rates were 100% and 82%, respectively, for both species. These results provided evidence for the first time that BgV can be transmitted horizontally by Cx. annulirostris, the primary vector of pathogenic zoonotic flaviviruses in Australia. We also assessed whether BgV could interfere with replication in vitro, and infection and transmission in vivo of super-infecting pathogenic Culex-associated flaviviruses. BgV significantly reduced growth of Murray Valley encephalitis and West Nile (WNV) viruses in vitro. While prior infection with BgV by injection did not inhibit WNV super-infection of Cx. annulirostris, significantly fewer BgV-infected mosquitoes could transmit WNV than mock-injected mosquitoes. Overall, these data contribute to our understanding of flavivirus ecology, modes of transmission by Australian mosquitoes and mechanisms for super-infection interference."

Unique hepaciviruses (HV) were discovered recently in animal hosts. The direct ancestor of HCV has not been found, but the genetically most closely related animal HVs exist in horses. To investigate whether other peridomestic animals also carry HVs, we analyzed sera from Ghanaian cattle for HVs by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Nine of 106 specimens from different sampling sites contained HV RNA (8.5%) at median viral loads of 1.6 Ã 10(5) copies/ml. Infection seemed unrelated to cattle age and gender. Near-full-genome sequencing of five representative viruses confirmed taxonomic classifications. Cattle HVs formed two distinct phylogenetic lineages that differed by up to 17.7% on the nucleotide level in the polyprotein-encoding region, suggesting cocirculation of different virus subtypes. A conserved microRNA122-binding site in the 5' internal ribosomal entry site suggested liver tropism of cattle HVs. Phylogenetic analyses suggested the circulation of HVs in cattle for several centuries. Cattle HVs were genetically highly divergent from all other HVs, including HCV. HVs from genetically related equine and bovine hosts were not monophyletic, corroborating host shifts during the evolution of the genus Hepacivirus. Similar to equine HVs, the genetic diversity of cattle HVs was low compared to that of HCV genotypes. This suggests an influence of the human-modified ecology of peridomestic animals on virus diversity. Further studies should investigate the occurrence of cattle HVs in other geographic areas and breeds, virus pathogenicity in cattle, and the potential exposure of human risk groups, such as farmers, butchers, and abattoir workers. HCV (genus Hepacivirus) is a major human pathogen, causing liver failure and cancer. Unique hepaciviruses (HVs) were discovered over the last few years in animals, but the direct ancestor of HCV has not been found. The animal HV most closely related to HCV so far originated from horses, suggesting that other livestock animals also harbor HVs. Therefore, we investigated African cattle and discovered previously unknown HVs at high prevalence and viral loads. Because of the agricultural importance of cattle, it may be relevant to investigate HV pathogenicity. The frequent exposure of humans to cattle also may warrant investigations of the zoonotic potential of these viruses. Evolutionary analyses suggested that cattle HVs have existed for centuries. Despite the genetic relatedness of their animal hosts, HVs from cattle and horses were not phylogenetically related, corroborating frequent host shifts during the evolution of the genus Hepacivirus."

Genetic and antigenic variation in HA has been used to classify influenza viruses into subtypes (H1-H16). The neutralizing antibody response to influenza virus is thought to be specific for a few antigenically related isolates within a given subtype. However, while heterosubtypic antibodies capable of neutralizing multiple influenza virus subtypes have been recently isolated from phage display libraries, it is not known whether such antibodies are produced in the course of an immune response to influenza virus infection or vaccine. Here we report that, following vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccine containing H1 and H3 influenza virus subtypes, some individuals produce antibodies that cross-react with H5 HA. By immortalizing IgG-expressing B cells from 4 individuals, we isolated 20 heterosubtypic mAbs that bound and neutralized viruses belonging to several HA subtypes (H1, H2, H5, H6, and H9), including the pandemic A/California/07/09 H1N1 isolate. The mAbs used different VH genes and carried a high frequency of somatic mutations. With the exception of a mAb that bound to the HA globular head, all heterosubtypic mAbs bound to acid-sensitive epitopes in the HA stem region. Four mAbs were evaluated in vivo and protected mice from challenge with influenza viruses representative of different subtypes. These findings reveal that seasonal influenza vaccination can induce polyclonal heterosubtypic neutralizing antibodies that cross-react with the swine-origin pandemic H1N1 influenza virus and with the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus."

Six groups of five animals received a virulent suspension of various strains of virus at a concentration of 10(3) TCID(50)/mL and the goats were observed for 15 days after infection. The CÃ´te-d'Ivoire 89 (CI89), Guinea Conakry and Bissau Guinea PPRV strains caused a peracute disease; the India-Calcutta strain caused acute disease; the Sudan-Sennar strain produced an acute to mild disease, while the Nigeria 75/1 wild-type strain caused a mild disease and the animals recovered. The viruses studied contained examples of PPRV from specific lineage groups based on their nucleoprotein PPRV gene. This experiment indicated that virulence characteristics might be a useful marker to help classify PPRV isolates."

Part of the 5' untranslated region and the 5' end of the gp53 (E2) coding sequence were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most field isolates segregated into genotypes Ib or II. Only one out of 28 field isolates belonged to genotype Ia. Interestingly, some type I strains were equally divergent from types Ia and Ib strains and clustered into additional subtypes within genotype I. Immune sera from young calves experimentally inoculated with field isolates first identified on the basis of their sequences were used in two-way neutralisation experiments. The results clearly differentiated type I from type II strains although some degree of cross-neutralisation was observed. Within type I, the new clusters could not be antigenically differentiated from the more prevalent type Ib strains or from type Ia strain NADL, suggesting that BVDV genotype I is antigenically homogeneous. The isolation of BVDV types I and II strains from cell lines and from a bovine vaccine suggest that molecular epidemiology surveillance is warranted for BVDV."

Next-generation sequencing provides a way to partially circumvent this limitation, since the methods required for data acquisition and analysis are largely species-independent. Comparative genomics and other 'omics' provide new opportunities to study the structure and function of various biological systems of wild species that are otherwise out of reach. Genomes of natural reservoir hosts can help to identify dominant pathways of virus-host interaction and to reveal differences between susceptible and resistant organisms, populations and species. This is of great scientific interest and may also provide a resource for the rational design of treatments for viral diseases in humans and livestock. In this way, we will 'learn from nature' and one day apply this knowledge to create disease-resistant livestock or develop novel therapeutic and prevention strategies. Reservoir host genomics will also open up possibilities for developing novel vaccines for wildlife, aid in the development of new diagnostic platforms, and have broad implications for developmental and evolutionary biology. In this review, the authors focus on natural reservoir hosts of viral pathogens, although most of the discussion points should be equally applicable to natural reservoirs of pathogenic bacteria, fungi or other parasites.

Although pigs are the natural host of Pseudorabies virus (PRV), the virus has a broad host range and may cause fatal encephalitis in many species. The United States obtained PRV-free status in 2004 after the virus was eradicated from domestic swineherds, but the virus is still present in feral swine populations. The current report describes PRV infection in 3 dogs that were used to hunt feral swine. The dogs developed clinical signs including facial pruritus with facial abrasions, dyspnea, vomiting, diarrhea, ataxia, muscle stiffness, and death. Two were euthanized, and 1 died within approximately 48 hr after onset of clinical signs. The salient histologic changes consisted of neutrophilic trigeminal ganglioneuritis with neuronophagia and equivocal intranuclear inclusion bodies. Pseudorabies virus was isolated from fresh tissues from 2 of the dogs, and immunohistochemistry detected the virus in the third dog. Virus sequencing and phylogeny, based upon available GenBank sequences, revealed that the virus was likely a field strain that was closely related to a cluster of PRV strains previously identified in Illinois. Though eradicated from domestic swine in the United States, PRV is present in populations of feral swine, and should therefore continue to be considered a possible cause of disease in dogs and other domestic animals with compatible clinical history and signs. Continued surveillance is necessary to prevent reintroduction of PRV into domestic swine."

To understand the relationship of H5N1 viruses circulating in poultry and those isolated from humans, comprehensive phylogenetic and molecular analyses of viruses collected from both hosts in Vietnam between 2003 and 2010 were performed. We examined the temporal and spatial distribution of human cases relative to H5N1 poultry outbreaks and characterized the genetic lineages and amino acid substitutions in each gene segment identified in humans relative to closely related viruses from avian hosts. Six hemagglutinin clades and 8 genotypes were identified in humans, all of which were initially identified in poultry. Several amino acid mutations throughout the genomes of viruses isolated from humans were identified, indicating the potential for poultry viruses infecting humans to rapidly acquire molecular markers associated with mammalian adaptation and antiviral resistance."

While clade 1.1 viruses persisted in southern regions, three genetically distinct subgroups of clade 2.3.2.1 were found in northern and central Vietnam. The identification of each subgroup corresponded with detection of novel reassortants, likely due to their overlapping circulation throughout the country. While the previously identified clade 1.1 and A/Hubei/1/2010-like 2.3.2.1 genotypes remained the predominant viruses detected, four viruses were found to be reassortants between A/Hubei/1/2010-like (HA, NA, PB2, PB1, PA, NP) and A/duck/Vietnam/NCVD-885/2010-like (M, NS) viruses and one virus was identified as having A/duck/Vietnam/NCVD-885/2010-like HA, NA, PB1, and NP with A/Hubei/1/2010-like PB2 and PA genes.

The progeny were assayed both on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and in tissue culture for resistance to representative viruses of the A, B, and tentatively defined C subgroups. Segregation ratios of resistance to A and B subgroup viruses agreed with the previously suggested hypothesis of single-autosomal-recessive genes controlling resistance to each subgroup. Mixed infection on the CAM and replicate plate infection in tissue culture with subgroup A and B viruses showed that resistance to the A and B subgroups was inherited independently. Assays with viruses tentatively classified as subgroup C indicated that they were largely composed of a mixture of subgroup A and B viruses or of particles possessing the host range specificity of both. However, virus stocks of the subgroup C category, as well as some stocks classified as subgroup B, produced small numbers of pocks or foci on individuals known to be resistant to subgroup A and B viruses. It is suggested that these Rous sarcoma virus stocks carry between 1 and 10% of a true subgroup C virus.</jats:p>"

However, the evolution and pathogenicity of H3 avian influenza virus (AIV) circulating in domestic birds in China remain largely unclear. In this study, seven H3 AIVs (four H3N2 and three H3N8) were isolated from poultry in live poultry market (LPM) in China. Phylogenetic analyses of full genomes showed that all viruses were clustered into Eurasian lineage, except N8 genes of two H3N8 isolates fell into North American lineage. Intriguingly, the N8 gene of one H3N8 and PB2, PB1, NP and NS of two H3N2 isolates have close relationship with those of the highly pathogenic H5N8 viruses circulating in Korea and United States, suggesting that the H3-like AIV may contribute internal genes to the highly pathogenic H5N8 viruses. Phylogenetic tree of HA gene and antigenic cross-reactivity results indicated that two antigenically different H3 viruses are circulating in LPM in China. Most of the H3 viruses replicated in mice lung and nasal turbinate without prior adaptation, and the representative H3 viruses infected chickens without causing clinical signs. The reassortment of H3 subtype influenza viruses warrants continuous surveillance in LPM in China."

Since April 2010, the outbreak of DTMUV in southeast provinces of China has caused great economic losses. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important regulatory roles in viral infection through binding to the host target genes or the viral genomes. To better understanding the molecular mechanisms of virus-host interaction, here we identified the miRNA expression profiles in DTMUV-infected and uninfected DEF cells by high-throughput sequencing. A total of 287 known and 63 novel miRNAs were identified. 48 miRNAs, including 26 known miRNAs and 22 novel miRNAs, were differentially expressed in response to DTMUV infection. Among these miRNAs, 37 miRNAs were up-regulated and 11 miRNAs were down-regulated. 9 miRNAs were randomly selected for validation by qRT-PCR experiment. The results of qRT-PCR experiment were consistent with the sequencing data. GO enrichment showed that the predicted targets of these differentially expressed miRNAs were mainly involved in the regulation of immune system, cellular process and metabolic process. KEGG pathways analysis showed that predicted target genes were involved in several signaling pathways such as Wnt signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway and FoxO signaling pathway. This is the first study to evaluate changes of miRNA expression in DEF cells upon DTMUV infection. Our findings provide important clues for better understanding the DTMUV-host interaction."

It is now experiencing a renaissance, coincident with an awakening of the role that evolutionary biology plays in human and animal health, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A number of STIs in humans have comparable infections in animals; likewise, both humans and animals have STIs unique to each mammalian camp.

Therefore the complete genome sequence of two distinct apathogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains was determined and a third genome size category, containing 15,198 nucleotides, was recognized. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that two major separations resulting in three genome size categories occurred during the history of NDV. An ancient division in the primordial reservoir (wild waterbird species) led to two basal sister clades, class I and II, with genome sizes 15,198 (due to a 12 nucleotide insert in the phosphoprotein gene) and 15,186 nucleotides, respectively. Ancestors of only class II viruses colonized chicken populations and subsequently converted to virulent forms. These took place more than once and resulted in an early lineage [including genotypes I-IV and H33(W)] with genome size of 15,186 nucleotides. A second division occurred in the 20th century in the secondary (chicken) host. This gave rise to the branching-off of a clade (including recent genotypes V-VIII consisting of only pathogenic viruses) with the concomitant insertion of six nucleotides into the 5' non-coding region of the nucleoprotein gene thereby increasing the genome size to 15,192 nucleotides."

At the beginning of the outbreak, little was known about Zika virus morphology, genome structure, modes of transmission, and its potential to cause neurological malformations and disorders. With the advancement of basic science, discoveries of the mechanisms of strain variability, viral transfer to the fetus, and neurovirulence were published. These will certainly lead to the development of strategies to block vertical viral transmission, neuronal invasion, and pathogenesis in the near future. This paper reviews the current literature on Zika virus infections, with the aim of gaining a holistic insight into their etiology and pathogenesis. We discuss Zika virus history and epidemiology in Brazil, viral structure and taxonomy, old and newly identified transmission modes, and neurological consequences of infection."

An adult male Border collie dog was definitively diagnosed with fatal LI and the lesion profile, LIV antigen distribution and full genome sequence of the LIV responsible were investigated to determine if this differed significantly from sheep-derived LIV. No gross lesions were present. The histological lesions were confined to the central nervous system and comprised of lymphocytic perivascular cuffs, glial foci, neuronal necrosis and neuronophagia. Immunolocalization of viral antigen showed small amounts present in neurons only. These histological and immunohistochemical findings were similar to those reported in affected sheep. Compared with published full genome sequences of sheep-derived LIV, only very minor differences were present and phylogenetically the virus clustered individually between a subclade containing Scottish strains, LIV 369/T2 and GÂ and another subclade containing an English isolate LIV A. The LIV isolated from the dog shares a common progenitor with LIV A. These findings suggest there is no canine-specific LIV strain, dogs are susceptible to sheep-associated strains of LI and with the increase in tick prevalence,Â and therefore exposure to LIV, a safe, effective vaccine for dogs may be required."

A recent study has indicated a potential case of human infection by TMUV, highlighting the need for further study of TMUV, especially its evolution. Because no information exists regarding the evolution of TMUV, we conducted comprehensive phylogenetic analyses using the largest collection of complete open reading frame (ORF) sequences of TMUV. Our results indicated that two lineages of viruses were associated with the 2010 outbreak in China, and lineage II, in particular sublineage II-c, has arisen as the dominant lineage currently circulating. We inferred that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of this TMUV was emerged around 1996. Evidence of natural recombination was also detected in TMUV. Molecular adaptation analyses revealed that strong negative selection shaped the evolution of TMUV, while a number of codons subjected to positive pressure were also identified. Our study, for the first time, illustrated the evolutionary history and character of TMUV and will be helpful for vaccine and diagnostic development."

PCR screening of organ samples from pigs suspected to be affected with PMWS or PDNS revealed the presence of PCV-2 in 80% of the cases. Six PCV-2 genomes from Hungarian isolates were completely sequenced. Phylogenetic comparison with all the available PCV-2 sequences showed that porcine circoviruses circulating in Hungary are more variable than in several other European countries.

All PaPVs are zoonotic and may infect humans after direct or indirect contact with infected animals. Herein we report the development and validation of a highly sensitive real-time PCR assay for rapid detection of PaPVs. The new assay (referred to as the RVSS assay) was specific for PaPVs only and had no cross-reactivity against other pox viruses. Using a recombinant plasmid as positive control, the analytical sensitivity of the assay was determined to be 16 genome copies of PaPV per assay. The amplification efficiency estimate (91-99%), the intra- and interassay variability estimate (standard deviation [SD]: 0.28-1.06 and 0.01-0.14, respectively), and the operator variability estimate (SD: 0.78 between laboratories and 0.28 between operators within a laboratory) were within the acceptable range. The diagnostic specificity was assessed on 100 specimens from healthy normal animals and all but 1 tested negative (99%). The diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) was assessed on 77 clinical specimens (skin/scab) from infected sheep, goats, and cattle, and all tested positive (100%). The assay was multiplexed with beta-actin as an internal positive control, and the multiplex assay exhibited the same DSe as the singleplex assay. Further characterization of the PaPV specimens by species-specific real-time PCR and nucleotide sequencing of the PCR products following conventional PCR showed the presence of Orf virus not only in sheep and goats but also in 1 bovid. The validated RVSS assay demonstrated high specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, and ruggedness, which are critical for laboratory detection of PaPVs."

However, extensive PCV2 ORF2 sequence databases in veterinary diagnostic laboratories have not been analyzed systematically to determine the genetic diversity of field isolates. Here, we interrogated >1100 PCV2 ORF2 nucleotide sequences to assess population diversity and genetic variation. We detected a novel PCV2 genotype that is substantially different, primarily in ORF2, from all known PCV2. Notably, ORF2 contains a unique carboxyl terminal amino acid insertion resulting in a 238 amino acid ORF2. All other PCV2 ORF2 proteins are 233 or 234 aa in length. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that it is more ancient than other PCV2 genotypes. The findings demonstrate the value of analyzing routine diagnostic laboratory sequence databases in population genetic analyses of animal pathogens."

From originally causing a relatively mild and sporadic disease, PEDV has been more recently associated with severe outbreaks of diarrheal disease in Asia, and subsequently North America. PEDV shares some important characteristics with two major pandemic viruses (porcine reproductive and respiratory virus; porcine circovirus type 2) of pigs that have high rates of mutation and high host specificity, and appear to have been present in the swine virome for decades prior to emerging to cause severe clinical disease. A unique feature of the PEDV in North America has been the implication of feed as a vehicle for transmission, with particular concerns related to ingredients of porcine origin. The importance of relatively rare events in contributing to both the emergence and transmission of PEDV is discussed in relation to approaches for managing the associated risks."

National and regional surveys using molecular diagnostics have revealed that suspect viruses continuously circulate in United States poultry, with many viruses appearing concomitantly and in healthy birds. High-throughput nucleic acid pyrosequencing is a powerful diagnostic technology capable of determining the full genomic repertoire present in a complex environmental sample. We utilized the Roche/454 Life Sciences GS-FLX platform to compile an RNA virus metagenome from turkey flocks experiencing enteric disease. This approach yielded numerous sequences homologous to viruses in the BLAST nr protein database, many of which have not been described in turkeys.

Investigations characterizing the poultry enteric virome have identified novel poultry viruses, but the roles these viruses play in disease and performance problems have yet to be fully characterized. The complex bacterial community present in the poultry gut influences gut development, immune status, and animal health, each of which can be an indicator of overall performance. The present metagenomic investigation was undertaken to provide insight into the colonization of specific pathogen free chickens by enteric microorganisms under field conditions and to compare the pre-contact intestinal microbiome with the altered microbiome following contact with poultry raised in the field. Analysis of the intestinal virome from contact birds (""sentinels"") placed on farms revealed colonization by members of the Picornaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Reoviridae, and Astroviridae that were not present in pre-contact birds or present in proportionally lower numbers. Analysis of the sentinel gut bacterial community revealed an altered community in the post-contact birds, notably by members of the Lachnospiracea/Clostridium and Lactobacillus families and genera. Members of the avian enteric Reoviridae and Astroviridae have been well-characterized and have historically been implicated in poultry enteric disease; members of the Picobirnaviridae and Picornaviridae have only relatively recently been described in the poultry and avian gut, and their roles in the recognized disease syndromes and in poultry performance in general have not been determined. This metagenomic analysis has provided insight into the colonization of the poultry gut by enteric microbes circulating in commercial broiler flocks, and has identified enteric viruses and virus communities that warrant further study in order to understand their role(s) in avian gut health and disease."

In addition to these largely undescribed-and therefore relatively poorly understood-poultry enteric viral families, these metagenomic analyses have also revealed the presence of well-known groups of enteric viruses such as the chicken and turkey astroviruses (family Astroviridae) and the avian rotaviruses and reoviruses (family Reoviridae). The order Picornavirales is a group of viruses in flux, particularly among the avian picornaviruses, since several new genera have been described recently based upon community analysis of enteric viromes from poultry and other avian species worldwide. Our previous investigation of the turkey enteric picornaviruses suggests the avian enteric picornaviruses may contribute to the enteric disease syndromes and performance problems often observed in turkeys in the Southeastern United States.

In an effort to explore the diversity of cycloviruses and better understand the evolution of these novel ssDNA viruses, here we present five cycloviruses isolated from three dragonfly species (Orthetrum sabina, Xanthocnemis zealandica and Rhionaeschna multicolor) collected in Australia, New Zealand and the USA, respectively. The genomes of these five viruses share similar genome structure to other cycloviruses, with a circular ~1.7 kb genome and two major bidirectionally transcribed ORFs. The genomic sequence data gathered during this study were combined with all cyclovirus genomes available in public databases to identify conserved motifs and regulatory elements in the intergenic regions, as well as determine diversity and recombinant regions within their genomes. The genomes reported here represent four different cyclovirus species, three of which are novel. Our results confirm that cycloviruses circulate widely in winged-insect populations; in eight different cyclovirus species identified in dragonflies to date, some of these exhibit a broad geographical distribution. Recombination analysis revealed both intra- and inter-species recombination events amongst cycloviruses, including genomes recovered from disparate sources (e.g. goat meat and human faeces). Similar to other well-characterized circular ssDNA viruses, recombination may play an important role in cyclovirus evolution."

Serum, bile, liver, lymph nodes and faeces of 69 animals from 1 week to 4 months of age with different pathological conditions were collected. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect HEV and histopathology of tissues was conducted. Positive RT-PCR samples were sequenced and phylogenetically analysed. HEV was detected in at least one sample in 26 out of 69 animals (37.7%). Bile was the most frequently positive sample, followed by mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, faeces and serum. HEV was detected in pigs of 1 (n = 7), 2 (n = 8) and 3 (n = 11) months of age. A total of 22 of 69 (31.9%) pigs had mild to moderate hepatitis and 15 of them were HEV RT-PCR positive in at least one of the tested samples. The highest sensitivity of viral detection was achieved using samples that cannot be obtained from live pigs, such as liver, mesenteric lymph node and bile. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed that all Spanish swine HEV strains detected belonged to genotype III. Therefore, genotype III strains are present in a relative high proportion of pigs between 1 and 3 months of age. Through this study, it cannot be ruled out if concomitant infections may influence the distribution of HEV in infected pigs."

In contrast to swine H3N2 viruses, no significant antigenic drift was observed in swine H1N1 viruses isolated from the late 1980s up to 1996 inclusive. However, a marked antigenic and genetic heterogeneity in haemagglutination inhibition tests and nucleotide sequence analyses was detected among the 26 recent swine H1N1 virus strains. Interestingly, the observed antigenic and molecular variants were not randomly distributed over the farms. This finding indicates independent introductions of different swine H1N1 virus variants at the various farms of the study and points to a marked difference between the epidemiologies of human and swine influenza viruses. The observed heterogeneity may hamper the control of swine influenza by vaccination and indicates that the efficacy of current swine influenza vaccines requires re-evaluation and that the antigenic reactivity of swine influenza viruses should be monitored on a regular basis."

This expanded Giardiavirus clade comprises two monophyletic groups, one of them including Giardia lamblia virus (GLV) grouped with viruses that infect arthropods and vertebrates (GLV-like group), and the other includes the previously proposed Artivirus group (IMNV-like group). A screening of the members of the GLV-like group in search of genomic elements already described in IMNV-like group revealed the existence of sites with a high propensity to become 2âA-like oligopeptides, mainly in a specific subgroup of arthropod viruses, suggesting that these viruses preserved ancestral characteristics. The existence of these ""pseudo 2âA-sites"" associated to phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that these sequences appear at a decisive stage for viral evolution.

Infections of adults are mostly asymptomatic or associated with only mild symptoms, while transplacental crossing of these viruses to the developing fetus can have important teratogenic effects. Research mainly focused on congenital malformations has established a correlation between the developmental stage at which a fetus is infected and the outcome of an Akabane virus infection. Available data suggest that a similar correlation also applies to Schmallenberg virus infections but is not yet entirely conclusive. Experimental and field data furthermore suggest that Akabane virus is more efficient in inducing congenital malformations than Aino and Schmallenberg virus, certainly in cattle. The mechanism by which these Simbu viruses cross-pass yearly periods of very low vector abundance in temperate climate zones remains undefined. Yearly wind-borne reintroductions of infected midges from tropical endemic regions with year-round vector activity have been proposed, just as overwintering in long-lived adult midges. Experimental and field data however indicate that a role of vertical virus transmission in the ruminant host currently cannot be excluded as an overwintering mechanism. More studies on Culicoides biology and specific groups of transplacentally infected newborn ruminants without gross malformations are needed to shed light on this matter."

Teats of milking cows are occasionally affected, and the infection is frequently transmitted to human beings. The present report describes an outbreak of BPSV infection affecting cows in midwestern Brazil, with human involvement. The disease was observed in neighboring small hand-milking farms, affecting 20 milking cows. The signs included painful reddish papules, ulcers, and scabby proliferative lesions on the teats, with a clinical course of 7-12 days. Affected cows presented severe local pain, not allowing the completion of milking. Histologically, acanthosis, spongiosis, and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis with adjacent focally extensive ulcers and multifocal inflammatory infiltrate were observed in the epidermis. Eosinophilic inclusion bodies were noted in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. Personnel milking the affected cows developed lesions on the hands, painful papules that progressed to ulcerative and scabby lesions in 4-7 days. A polymerase chain reaction using a set of pan-parapoxvirus primers for the B2L gene performed on DNA extracted from scabs amplified a 590-bp product, which when sequenced, revealed similarities of 99%, 85%, and 84% with BPSV, Pseudocowpox virus, and Orf virus, respectively.

Later, FVs were isolated in several mammal species such as cats, cattle and horses. Highly prevalent in non-human primates they are not naturally present in humans, although several cases of simian-to-human transmissions have been described. Interestingly, the replication strategy of FVs differs in many aspects from that of other retroviruses, presenting features that are closely related to pararetroviruses, exemplified by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), but also characteristics that are closely related to yeast retrotransposons. These characteristics led to the creation of a distinct viral subfamily by the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy in 2002; the Spumaretrovirinae."

The data were generated by using MiSeq 2Â ÃÂ 250Â bp and HiSeq 2Â ÃÂ 150Â bp Illumina sequencing platforms for 16S amplicon and WGSM sequencing, respectively. Each approach revealed a distinct microbial community profile, with Pseudomonas and Psychrobacter as predominant genus for the WGSM dataset and Clostridium and Methanosaeta for the 16S rRNA gene amplicon dataset. The virome characterization revealed the presence of two viral families with Bacteria and Archaea as host, Myoviridae, and Siphoviridae. A wide functional diversity was found with predominance of genes involved in the metabolism of acetone, butanol, and ethanol synthesis; and one-carbon metabolism (e.g., methanogenesis). Genes related to the acetotrophic methanogenesis pathways were more abundant than methylotrophic and hydrogenotrophic, corroborating the taxonomic results that showed the prevalence of the acetotrophic genus Methanosaeta. Moreover, the dataset indicated a variety of metabolic genes involved in sulfur, nitrogen, iron, and phosphorus cycles, with many genera able to act in all cycles. BLAST analysis against Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database (ARDB) revealed that microbial community contained 43 different types of antibiotic resistance genes, some of them were associated with growth chicken promotion (e.g., bacitracin, tetracycline, and polymyxin)."

The hypothesis of pathogenic MHC class I molecules in the vaccine had been put up, but no formal proof of specific causal MHC class I alleles has been provided yet. However, the unique features of the vaccine obviously result in extremely high specific antibody titres in the vaccinated animals, but apparently also in further molecules inducing BNP. Thus, a comprehensive picture of the immune response to the vaccine is essential. Applying the novel approach of next generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq), our study provides a new holistic, comprehensive analysis of the blood transcriptome regulation after vaccination with the specific BVDV vaccine. Our RNAseq approach identified a novel cytokine-like gene in the bovine genome that is highly upregulated after vaccination. This gene has never been described before in any other species and might be specific to ruminant immune response. Furthermore, our data revealed a very coordinated immune response to double-stranded (ds) RNA or a dsRNA analogue after vaccination with the inactivated single-stranded (ss) RNA vaccine. This would suggest either a substantial contamination of the vaccine with dsRNA from host cells after virus culture or a dsRNA analogue applied to the vaccine. The first option would highlight the potential risks associated with virus culture on homologous cells during vaccine production; the latter option would emphasise the potential risks associated with immune stimulating adjuvants used in vaccine production.</jats:p>"

The results indicate a predominance of herpesviruses from the Mardivirus genus, coming from either vaccinal origin or presumably asymptomatic infection. Despite the high sensitivity of the HTS method used herein to detect small circular DNA viruses, we did not detect any papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses, or circoviruses, indicating that these viruses may not be resident of the chicken skin. The results suggest that the turkey herpesvirus is a resident of chicken skin in vaccinated chickens. This study indicates major differences between the skin viromes of chickens and humans.

To investigate the relationship between the H1N1pdm viruses isolated from piggery outbreaks in Australia and human samples associated with one of the outbreaks by phylogenetic analysis, and to determine whether there was any reassortment event occurring during the human-pig interspecies transmission. Real-time RT-PCR and full genome sequencing were carried out on RNA isolated from nasal swabs and/or virus cultures. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Geneious package. The influenza H1N1pdm outbreaks were detected in three pig farms located in three different states in Australia. Further analysis of the Queensland outbreak led to the identification of two distinct virus strains in the pigs. Two staff working in the same piggery were also infected with the same two strains found in the pigs. Full genome sequence analysis on the viruses isolated from pigs and humans did not identify any reassortment of these H1N1pdm viruses with seasonal or avian influenza A viruses. This is the first report of swine infected with influenza in Australia and marked the end of the influenza-free era for the Australian swine industry.

          <jats:p>The continued success of the live attenuated varicella-zoster virus vaccine in preventing varicella-zoster and herpes zoster is well documented, as are many of the mutations that contribute to the attenuation of the vOka virus for replication in skin. At least three different preparations of vOka are marketed. Here, we show using deep sequencing of seven batches of vOka vaccine (including ZostaVax, VariVax, VarilRix, and the Oka/Biken working seed) from three different manufacturers (VariVax, GSK, and Biken) that 137 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations are present in all vaccine batches. This includes six sites at which the vaccine allele is fixed or near fixation, which we speculate are likely to be important for attenuation. We also show that despite differences in the vaccine populations between preparations, batch-to-batch variation is minimal, as is the number and frequency of mutations unique to individual batches. This suggests that the vaccine manufacturing processes are not introducing new mutations and that, notwithstanding the mixture of variants present, VZV live vaccines are extremely stable.</jats:p>

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            The continued success of vaccinations to prevent chickenpox and shingles, combined with the extremely low incidence of adverse reactions, indicates the quality of these vaccines. The vaccine itself is comprised of a heterogeneous live attenuated virus population and thus requires deep-sequencing technologies to explore the differences and similarities in the virus populations between different preparations and batches of the vaccines. Our data demonstrate minimal variation between batches, an important safety feature, and provide new insights into the extent of the mutations present in this attenuated virus.

The BHV1 UL28 ORF, located at positions 53058-->55538 of the viral genome, encodes a viral specific transcript of 3.4 kb detected at 6 h post-infection (p.i.) after which its levels accumulated up to 12 h p.i. and then remained constant up to 24 h p.i. Transcription of the BHV1 UL28 was determined to initiate 95 bases upstream from the ORF's initiating codon, which corresponds to 33 nucleotides downstream from a putative TATA box. A BHV1 UL28 specific antiserum, generated against a T7-Tag/UL28 fusion protein expressed in E. coli, specifically reacted with a 100 kDa protein in Western blots of BHV1-infected protein cell lysates. The expression kinetics of the protein was delayed by 6 h relative to that of its transcript suggesting that the gene is regulated at the translational level. In contrast to the HSV and pseudorabies virus UL28 genes, which belong to viral genes of the early (beta) class, that of BHV1 was unambiguously classified as a gamma2 gene. Further studies will be required to determine whether these kinetic differences have any functional implications."

Current molecular diagnostic tools mainly rely on the specific amplification of marker sequences and may overlook infections caused by unknown and rare pathogens. Using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) can solve this problem; but, due to the extremely low fraction of pathogen genetic material in clinical samples, its application is only cost-effective in special, rather than routine, cases. In this study, we present a method for the semi-specific enrichment of viral conservative sequences in a HTS library by hybridization in solution with genus-specific degenerate biotinylated oligonucleotides. Nucleic acids of the test viruses (yellow fever virus and Japanese encephalitis virus) were enriched by solution hybrid selection using pan-flavivirus oligonucleotides. Moreover, enterovirus (family: <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic>, genus: <jats:italic>Enterovirus</jats:italic>) sequences were successfully enriched using foot-and-mouth disease virus (family: <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic>, genus: <jats:italic>Aphthovirus</jats:italic>) oligonucleotide. The enrichment factor relative to the background nucleic acid was about 1,000-fold. As hybridization has less stringent oligonucleotide match requirements than PCR, few oligonucleotides are sufficient to cover the potential sequence variation in the whole genus and may even enrich nucleic acids of viruses of other related genera. Efficient enrichment of viral sequences makes its use in diagnostics cost-efficient.</jats:p>"

Different individuals have distinct phage genotypes, and shifts in variant frequencies over consecutive sampling days reflect changes in the relative abundance of phage subpopulations. Recent homologous recombination has resulted in extensive genome admixture of nine baboon Lak phage populations. We infer that Lak phages are widespread in gut communities that contain the Prevotella species, and conclude that megaphages, with fascinating and underexplored biology, may be common but largely overlooked components of human and animal gut microbiomes."

Recently, a novel PRV (formerly PRV-Om, here called PRV-3), was found in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) with HSMI-like disease. PRV is considered to be an emerging pathogen in farmed salmonids. In this study, molecular and antigenic characterization of PRV-3 was performed. Erythrocytes are the main target cells for PRV, and blood samples that were collected from experimentally challenged fish were used as source of virus. Virus particles were purified by gradient ultracentrifugation and the complete coding sequences of PRV-3 were obtained by Illumina sequencing. When compared to PRV-1, the nucleotide identity of the coding regions was 80.1%, and the amino acid identities of the predicted PRV-3 proteins varied from 96.7% (Î»1) to 79.1% (Ï3). Phylogenetic analysis showed that PRV-3 belongs to a separate cluster. The region encoding Ï3 were sequenced from PRV-3 isolates collected from rainbow trout in Europe. These sequences clustered together, but were distant from PRV-3 that was isolated from rainbow trout in Norway. Bioinformatic analyses of PRV-3 proteins revealed that predicted secondary structures and functional domains were conserved between PRV-3 and PRV-1. Rabbit antisera raised against purified virus or various recombinant virus proteins from PRV-1 all cross-reacted with PRV-3. Our findings indicate that despite different species preferences of the PRV subtypes, several genetic, antigenic, and structural properties are conserved between PRV-1 and-3.</jats:p>"

The virus has been circulating in parts of sub-Saharan Africa for several decades and in the Middle East and southern Asia since 1993, although the first description of the virus in India dates to 1987. To study the genetic relationship between isolates of distinct geographical origin, a selected region of the fusion (F) protein gene of the viruses was amplified using RT/PCR and the resulting DNA product sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Viruses from 27 outbreaks in Asian and Middle Eastern countries, reported between 1993 and 2000, and two recent outbreaks from the African continent were compared with the prototype African strain. Of the four known lineages of PPR virus, lineage 1 and 2 viruses have been found exclusively in west Africa. Virus from an outbreak in Burkina Faso in 1999 fell into the lineage 1 group. Viruses of lineage 3 have been found in east Africa, where an outbreak in Ethiopia in 1996 was of this type, and also in Arabia and in southern India. However, there have been no further isolations of lineage 3 virus from India since the one reported in 1992 from Tamil Nadu. A virus of this lineage was found circulating in Yemen in 2001. In the past 8 years virus exclusively of the fourth lineage has spread across the Middle East and the Asian sub-continent, reaching east as far as Nepal and Bangladesh. This virus lineage was also reported from Kuwait in 1999. The geographical source of the new lineage 4 virus is unknown although it is most closely related to African lineage 1. The possibility that its earlier presence in northern India was masked by the circulation of Rinderpest virus, a related virus of cattle, is considered unlikely."

A total of 32 phages of independent origin were divided into six groups by applying the criteria of host range, antigenic homology, and the ultraviolet inducibility of the prophage. The demonstration of genetic interactions in some cases has confirmed the classification scheme. Nine phages were assigned to the P2 family and 19 to the lambda family. The remaining four isolates may represent some novel phylogenetic types. Phages recovered from the lysogenic strains of E. coli were all found to be P2 related, whereas a majority of the phages recovered as cell-free plaque-forming units were assignable to the lambda family. It is proposed that the biological attributes of the phages belonging to the two principal families are reflected in the distribution patterns observed. The virions of phage HK256 show multiple tail fibers and may thus represent a ""new"" virion form among the temperate coliphages.</jats:p>"

Upon sequence analysis of the RdRp fragment, the Italian viruses formed a tightly conserved group and resembled closely the nebovirus prototype Nebraska/80/US. The sequence of a 2.2kb ORF1 fragment, spanning the 3' end of the RdRp and the full-length capsid coding region, of two nebovirus strains was determined, revealing marked genetic heterogeneity in the capsid protein, as the two Italian viruses were classified into two distinct capsid lineages, and suggesting a recombination event downstream the highly conserved shell (S) domain."

We indexed the genetic diversity and evolution of the virus at an intra-host level by deep sequencing the entire genome directly from nasal swabs collected at two separate samplings during infection. We obtained 13 IAV metagenomes from 13 samples, which included the virus inoculum and two samples from each of the six pigs that tested positive for IAV during the study. The infection produced a population of heterogeneous alleles (sequence variants) that was dynamic over time. Overall, 794 polymorphisms were identified amongst all samples, which yielded 327 alleles, 214 of which were unique sequences. A total of 43 distinct haemagglutinin proteins were translated, two of which were observed in multiple pigs, whereas the neuraminidase (NA) was conserved and only one dominant NA was found throughout the study. The genetic diversity of IAVs changed dynamically within and between pigs. However, most of the substitutions observed in the internal gene segments were synonymous. Our results demonstrated remarkable IAV diversity, and the complex, rapid and dynamic evolution of IAV during infection of vaccinated pigs that can only be appreciated with repeated sampling of individual animals and deep sequence analysis."

In contrast to most paramyxoviruses, NiV can infect a large variety of mammalian species. Due to this broad host range, its zoonotic potential, its high pathogenicity for humans, and the lack of effective vaccines or therapeutics, NiV was classified as a biosafety level 4 pathogen. This article provides an overview of the molecular characteristics of NiV focusing on the structure, functions, and unique biological properties of the two NiV surface glycoproteins, the receptor-binding G protein, and the fusion protein F. Since viral glycoproteins are major determinants for cell tropism and virus spread, a detailed knowledge of these proteins can help to understand the molecular basis of viral pathogenicity."

However, at least eight NDV strains were isolated from swine populations in China during 1999-2006, four of which were characterized genetically and phylogenetically. Genetic analysis revealed that JL106 and SP13 had a (112)G-R-Q-G-R-L(117) motif at the cleavage site of F protein, while JL01 and MP01 possessed a (112)G-K-Q-G-R-L(117) motif, which indicated that all of them were typical of low-virulence viruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length F gene sequences showed that JL106 and SP13 belonged to genotype II, similar to the commonly utilized commercial La Sota vaccine strain in China. While JL01 and MP01 clustered within genotype I, genetically identical to the V4 vaccine strain. The animal trials showed that JL106 can effectively infect chickens. The present results indicated that the use of live La Sota and V4 vaccines and close contact between avian and pigs maybe resulted in cross-species infection, therefore, it is necessary to further carry out swine NDV epidemiology surveillance."

Using two inbred White Leghorn chicken lines, line 6.3 and line 7.2 showing Marek's disease-resistant and -susceptible phenotypes, respectively, we used small RNA high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to investigate whether miRNAs are differently expressed in these two chicken lines after inducing necrotic enteritis (NE). The 12 miRNAs, selected from the most down-regulated or up-regulated miRNAs following NE induction, were confirmed by their expressions in real-time PCR. Among these miRNAs, miR-215, miR-217, miR-194, miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-216a, miR-216b, and miR-429 were highly expressed in intestine derived from line 7.2, whereas, miR-1782 and miR-499 were down-regulated. In spleen, miR-34b and miR-1684 were the most up-regulated miRNAs in line 6.3. Notably, five out of six target genes, CXCR5, BCL2, GJA1, TCF12, and TAB3 were differentially expressed between line 6.3 and line 7.2, and showed suppression in the MD-susceptible chicken line. Their expression levels were conversely correlated with those of miRNA obtained from both HTS and quantitative real-time PCR. These results suggest that some miRNAs are differentially altered in response to NE and they modulate the expression of their target genes in the two inbred lines. Collectively, HTS analysis of intestinal miRNAs from NE-afflicted inbred chickens showing different disease phenotypes led to the identification of host immunity genes regulated by miRNA. Future studies of the function of these miRNAs and their target genes in the host will lead to enhanced understanding of molecular mechanisms controlling host-pathogen interaction in NE."

They are a habitat for the larval stage of many insects and may serve as a medium for intraspecies and interspecies transmission of viruses such as avian influenza A virus. Furthermore, freshwater bodies are already known repositories for disease-causing viruses such as Norwalk Virus, Coxsackievirus, Echovirus, and Adenovirus. While RNA virus populations have been studied in marine environments, to this date there has been very limited analysis of the viral community in freshwater. Here we present a survey of RNA viruses in Lake Needwood, a freshwater lake in Maryland, USA. Our results indicate that just as in studies of other aquatic environments, the majority of nucleic acid sequences recovered did not show any significant similarity to known sequences. The remaining sequences are mainly from viral types with significant similarity to approximately 30 viral families. We speculate that these novel viruses may infect a variety of hosts including plants, insects, fish, domestic animals and humans. Among these viruses we have discovered a previously unknown dsRNA virus closely related to Banna Virus which is responsible for a febrile illness and is endemic to Southeast Asia. Moreover we found multiple viral sequences distantly related to Israeli Acute Paralysis virus which has been implicated in honeybee colony collapse disorder. Our data suggests that due to their direct contact with humans, domestic and wild animals, freshwater ecosystems might serve as repositories of a wide range of viruses (both pathogenic and non-pathogenic) and possibly be involved in the spread of emerging and pandemic diseases."

An fHbp library, engineered on a lambda phage vector enabling surface expression of polypeptides of widely different length, was subjected to massive parallel sequencing of the phage inserts after affinity selection with the 12C1 mAb. We detected dozens of unique antibody-selected sequences, the most enriched of which (designated as FrC) could largely recapitulate the ability of fHbp to bind mAb 12C1. Computational analysis of the cumulative enrichment of single amino acids in the antibody-selected fragments identified two overrepresented stretches of residues (H248-K254 and S140-G154), whose presence was subsequently found to be required for binding of FrC to mAb 12C1.

To comprehensively elucidate the genetic and evolutionary characteristics of H9N2 influenza viruses, we performed a large-scale sequence analysis of 571 viral genomes from the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource Database, representing the spectrum of H9N2 influenza viruses isolated from 1966 to 2009. Our study provides a panoramic framework for better understanding the genesis and evolution of H9N2 influenza viruses, and for describing the history of H9N2 viruses circulating in diverse hosts. Panorama phylogenetic analysis of the eight viral gene segments revealed the complexity and diversity of H9N2 influenza viruses. The 571 H9N2 viral genomes were classified into 74 separate lineages, which had marked host and geographical differences in phylogeny. Panorama genotypical analysis also revealed that H9N2 viruses include at least 98 genotypes, which were further divided according to their HA lineages into seven series (A-G). Phylogenetic analysis of the internal genes showed that H9N2 viruses are closely related to H3, H4, H5, H7, H10, and H14 subtype influenza viruses. Our results indicate that H9N2 viruses have undergone extensive reassortments to generate multiple reassortants and genotypes, suggesting that the continued circulation of multiple genotypical H9N2 viruses throughout the world in diverse hosts has the potential to cause future influenza outbreaks in poultry and epidemics in humans.

To evaluate the role of black-billed magpies (Pica pica) in the evolution of influenza A virus, we conducted two epidemic surveys on avian influenza viruses in wild black-billed magpies in Guangxi, China in 2005 and characterized three isolated black-billed magpie H9N2 viruses (BbM viruses). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that three BbM viruses were almost identical with 99.7 to 100% nucleotide homology in their whole genomes, and were reassortants containing BJ94-like (Ck/BJ/1/94) HA, NA, M, and NS genes, SH/F/98-like (Ck/SH/F/98) PB2, PA, and NP genes, and H5N1-like (Ck/YN/1252/03, clade 1) PB1 genes. Genetic analysis showed that BbM viruses were most likely the result of multiple reassortments between co-circulating H9N2-like and H5N1-like viruses, and were genetically different from other H9N2 viruses because of the existence of H5N1-like PB1 genes. Genotypical analysis revealed that BbM viruses evolved from diverse sources and belonged to a novel genotype (B46) discovered in our recent study. Molecular analysis suggested that BbM viruses were likely low pathogenic reassortants. However, results of our pathogenicity study demonstrated that BbM viruses replicated efficiently in chickens and a mammalian mouse model but were not lethal for infected chickens and mice. Antigenic analysis showed that BbM viruses were antigenic heterologous with the H9N2 vaccine strain. Our study is probably the first report to document and characterize H9N2 influenza viruses isolated from black-billed magpies in southern China. Our results suggest that black-billed magpies were susceptible to H9N2 influenza viruses, which raise concerns over possible transmissions of reassortant H9N2 viruses among poultry and wild birds."

Full-genome sequencing results indicate the two viruses can be classified into two sub-clusters that distinct from traditional European and US strains. To examine the potential role of the gE and gI proteins in ZJ01 virulence, we generated several recombinant viruses. In two chimeric viruses (rZJ01-LA/gEI and rLA-ZJ01/gEI), the gE and gI genes were swapped using corresponding genes from ZJ01 and LA. rZJ01-LA/gEI and the parental virus rZJ01 retained high virulence in piglets, although the survival time for rZJ01-LA/gEI infected piglets was obviously prolonged. In contrast, rLA-ZJ01/gEI exhibited higher virulence than its parental virus rLA. We conclude that changes in gE and gI proteins partly contribute to the enhanced virulence of ZJ01 strain."

Previous studies describing the evolutionary dynamics of ALV-J genetic variants mainly focused on the early infection period or few randomly selected clones. Here, we inoculated 30 specific-pathogen-free chickens with the same founder ALV-J stock of known genetic background. Six (three antibody positive and three antibody negative) chickens were selected among 15 chickens with viremia.

Our results showed that host humoral immunity could greatly enhance the genetic diversity of ALV-J genetic variants. In particular, selection pressures promoted a dynamic proportional changes in ALV-J genetic variants frequency. Cross-neutralization experiment showed that along with the change of the dominant variant, the antibody titers specific to infectious clones corresponding to the most dominant variants in weeks 12 and 28 have also changed significantly in sera collected in weeks 16 and 32. In contrast, no shift of dominant variant was observed in antibody-negative chickens. Moreover, we identified a novel hypervariable region in the gp85 gene. Our study reveals the interaction between ALV-J and the host, which could facilitate the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs."

This protein has multiple essential roles in the replication cycle involving RNA binding, viroplasm formation, helicase and can hydrolyse the Î³-phosphate of RNA and NTPs acting as an RTPase and NTPase. In studying sequences from rotavirus strains isolated in Australia between 1984 and 2009, the NSP2 gene was seen to be highly conserved and clustered with defined NSP2 genotypes N1 and N2 according to the full genome based rotavirus classification system. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that NSP2 gene sequences isolated from Australian rotavirus strains formed four distinct lineages. Temporal variation was observed in several clusters during the 26 year period, with lineage D identified throughout the entire study period and lineage A only detected since 1999. Phylogenetic analysis and dendrograms identified NSP2 genes that exhibited reassortment between different virus VP7 genotypes, as well as a sequence from a human strain that grouped closely with the NSP2 genes of bovine rotavirus strains. This study also identified a sequence that fell between lineages and exhibited evidence of recombination, the first time that intergenic recombination has been detected in a NSP2 gene sequence. This study increases the understanding of the evolution mechanisms of NSP2 in view of improved vaccine design."

They provide vital ecosystem services, some species are useful models in biomedical research and some are held as pet animals. However, many rodent species can have adverse effects such as damage to crops and stored produce, and they are of health concern because of the transmission of pathogens to humans and livestock. The first rodent viruses were discovered by isolation approaches and resulted in break-through knowledge in immunology, molecular and cell biology, and cancer research. In addition to rodent-specific viruses, rodent-borne viruses are causing a large number of zoonotic diseases. Most prominent examples are reemerging outbreaks of human hemorrhagic fever disease cases caused by arena- and hantaviruses. In addition, rodents are reservoirs for vector-borne pathogens, such as tick-borne encephalitis virus and Borrelia spp., and may carry human pathogenic agents, but likely are not involved in their transmission to human. In our days, next-generation sequencing or high-throughput sequencing (HTS) is revolutionizing the speed of the discovery of novel viruses, but other molecular approaches, such as generic RT-PCR/PCR and rolling circle amplification techniques, contribute significantly to the rapidly ongoing process. However, the current knowledge still represents only the tip of the iceberg, when comparing the known human viruses to those known for rodents, the mammalian taxon with the largest species number. The diagnostic potential of HTS-based metagenomic approaches is illustrated by their use in the discovery and complete genome determination of novel borna- and adenoviruses as causative disease agents in squirrels. In conclusion, HTS, in combination with conventional RT-PCR/PCR-based approaches, resulted in a drastically increased knowledge of the diversity of rodent viruses. Future improvements of the used workflows, including bioinformatics analysis, will further enhance our knowledge and preparedness in case of the emergence of novel viruses. Classical virological and additional molecular approaches are needed for genome annotation and functional characterization of novel viruses, discovered by these technologies, and evaluation of their zoonotic potential."

Tropical genotypes 1 and 2 are associated with food-borne and waterborne transmission. Zoonotic reservoirs (mainly pigs, wild boar, and deer) are considered for genotypes 3 and 4, which exist in temperate climates. In view of the association of several zoonotic viruses with bats, we analyzed 3,869 bat specimens from 85 different species and from five continents for hepevirus RNA. HEVs were detected in African, Central American, and European bats, forming a novel phylogenetic clade in the family Hepeviridae. Bat hepeviruses were highly diversified and comparable to human HEV in sequence variation. No evidence for the transmission of bat hepeviruses to humans was found in over 90,000 human blood donations and individual patient sera. Full-genome analysis of one representative virus confirmed formal classification within the family Hepeviridae. Sequence- and distance-based taxonomic evaluations suggested that bat hepeviruses constitute a distinct genus within the family Hepeviridae and that at least three other genera comprising human, rodent, and avian hepeviruses can be designated. This may imply that hepeviruses invaded mammalian hosts nonrecently and underwent speciation according to their host restrictions. Human HEV-related viruses in farmed and peridomestic animals might represent secondary acquisitions of human viruses, rather than animal precursors causally involved in the evolution of human HEV."

Wugang Prefecture is located on the Eastern Asian-Australian migratory bird flyway, and a human death due to an H5N6 virus was reported in the prefecture on 21 November 2016. In total, we sampled and sequenced the complete genomes of 175 H5N6 AIVs. Notably, our analysis revealed that H5N6 AIVs contain at least six genotypes arising from segment reassortment, including a rare variant that possesses an HA gene derived from H5N1 clade 2.3.2 and a novel NP gene that has its origins with H7N3 viruses. In addition, phylogenetic analysis revealed that genetically similar H5N6 AIVs tend to cluster according to their geographic regions of origin.

We studied a case of orf virus infection that occurred at Qingyuan City, Guangdong Province in southern China. An orf virus strain, GDQY, was successfully isolated and identified through cell culture techniques and transmission electron microscopy. Complete genes of ORFV011, ORFV059, ORFV106 and ORFV107 were amplified for the sequence analysis based on their nucleotide or amino acid level. In order to discuss the genetic variation, precise sequences were used to compare to other reference strains isolated from different districts or countries. Phylogenetic trees based on those strains were built up and evolutionary distances were calculated based on the alignment of their complete sequences. The typical structure of the orf virus was observed in cell-culture suspensions inoculated with GDQY, and the full-length of four genes was amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that GDQY is homologous to FJ-DS and CQ/WZ on ORFV011 nucleotides. ORFV059 may be more variable than ORFV011 based on the comparison between GDQY and other isolates.

The virus was highly virulent to chicken, killing them within two days of the experimental inoculation with an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of 2.88. For genetic and phylogenetic analyses, complete genome sequencing of 4 viral isolates was carried out. The isolates revealed multiple basic amino acids at their hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site, similar to other ""Qinghai-like"" H5N1 isolates. The receptor-binding site of HA molecule contained avian-like amino acids ((222)Q and (224)G). The isolates also contained amino acid residue K at position 627 of the PB2 protein, and other markers in NS 1 and PB1 proteins, highlighting the risk to mammals. However, the isolates were sensitive to influenza drugs presently available in the market. The sequence analysis indicated that the Bhutan viruses shared 99.1-100% nucleotide homology in all the eight genes among themselves and 2010 chicken isolate from Bangladesh (A/chicken/Bangladesh/1151-11/2010) indicating common progenitor virus. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Bhutan isolates belonged to sub-clade 2.2.3 (EMA 3) and shared common progenitor virus with the 2010 Bangladesh virus. Based on the evidence of phylogeny and molecular markers, it could be concluded that the outbreaks in Bhutan and Bangladesh in 2010 were due to independent introductions of the virus probably through migratory birds."

Phylogenetic analysis of full-length sequences of the spike 1 (S1) gene revealed a new genotype of IBV that we refer to as 'IBADAN'. The minimum genetic distance to the closest 'non-IBADAN' strains (UK/7/93 at the nucleotide level; H120 and M41 at the amino acid level) reached 24 and 32 % at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. The full genome of the IBADAN reference strain (NGA/A116E7/2006) had a genetic distance of 9.7-16.4 % at the nucleotide level with all available fully sequenced strains. As IBV S1 plays a major role in antigenicity, the antigenic relatedness of NGA/A116E7/2006 was compared with strains of other serotypes. NGA/A116E7/2006 did not cross-react with antisera against IT02, M41, D274, Connecticut or 793/B strains in virus neutralization assays. NGA/A116E7/2006 cross-reacted with the QX-like strain ITA/90254/2005 but only to a low level (antigenic relatedness of 33 %), suggesting that IBADAN also represents a new serotype. A comparison of S1 sequences identified several amino acids that may play a role in IBV antigenicity. Despite the absence of obvious clinical signs in poultry infected by IBADAN strains, it is important to test the cross-protection of current vaccine strains."

Cluster analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed differences in the distribution of bacterial phylotypes between Wet and Dry litter samples and between houses. Wet litter contained greater diversity with 90% of total bacterial abundance occurring within the top 214 OTU clusters. In contrast, only 50 clusters accounted for 90% of Dry litter bacterial abundance. The sixth largest OTU cluster across all samples classified as an Arcobacter sp., an emerging human pathogen, occurring in only the Wet litter samples of a house with a modern evaporative cooling system. Ironically, the primary pathogenic clostridial and staphylococcal species associated with GD were not found in any house; however, there were thirteen 16S rRNA gene phylotypes of mostly gram-positive phyla that were unique to GD-affected houses and primarily occurred in Wet litter samples. Overall, the poultry house environment appeared to substantially impact the composition of litter bacterial communities and may play a key role in the emergence of food-borne pathogens."

Cattle are the natural host of BLV where it integrates into B-cells, producing a lifelong infection. Most infected animals remain asymptomatic but following a protracted latency period about 5Â % develop an aggressive leukemia/lymphoma, mirroring the disease trajectory of HTLV-1. The mechanisms by which these viruses provoke cellular transformation remain opaque. In both viruses little or no transcription is observed from the 5'LTR in tumors, however the proviruses are not transcriptionally silent. In the case of BLV a cluster of RNA polymerase III transcribed microRNAs are highly expressed, while the HTLV-1 antisense transcript HBZ is consistently found in all tumors examined. Here, using RNA-seq, we demonstrate that the BLV provirus also constitutively expresses antisense transcripts in all leukemic and asymptomatic samples examined. The first transcript (AS1) can be alternately polyadenylated, generating a transcript of ~600Â bp (AS1-S) and a less abundant transcript of ~2200Â bp (AS1-L). Alternative splicing creates a second transcript of ~400Â bp (AS2). The coding potential of AS1-S/L is ambiguous, with a small open reading frame of 264Â bp, however the transcripts are primarily retained in the nucleus, hinting at a lncRNA-like role. The AS1-L transcript overlaps the BLV microRNAs and using high throughput sequencing of RNA-ligase-mediated (RLM) 5'RACE, we show that the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) cleaves AS1-L. Furthermore, experiments using altered BLV proviruses with the microRNAs either deleted or inverted point to additional transcriptional interference between the two viral RNA species. The identification of novel viral antisense transcripts shows the BLV provirus to be far from silent in tumors. Furthermore, the consistent expression of these transcripts in both leukemic and nonmalignant clones points to a vital role in the life cycle of the virus and its tumorigenic potential. Additionally, the cleavage of the AS1-L transcript by the BLV encoded microRNAs and the transcriptional interference between the two viral RNA species suggest a shared role in the regulation of BLV."

Susceptibility of hybrid hosts to pathogens is thought to be a common phenomenon that could promote host population divergence and subsequently speciation. However, few studies have tested for pathogen infection across animal hybrid zones while testing for codivergence of the pathogens in the hybridizing host complex. Over 8 y, we studied natural infection by a rapidly evolving single-strand DNA virus, beak and feather diseases virus (BFDV), which infects parrots, exploiting a host-ring species complex (Platycercus elegans) in Australia. We found that host subspecies and their hybrids varied strikingly in both BFDV prevalence and load: both hybrid and phenotypically intermediate subspecies had lower prevalence and load compared with parental subspecies, while controlling for host age, sex, longitude and latitude, as well as temporal effects. We sequenced viral isolates throughout the range, which revealed patterns of genomic variation analogous to Mayr's ring-species hypothesis, to our knowledge for the first time in any host-pathogen system. Viral phylogeny, geographic location, intraspecific host density, and parrot community diversity and composition did not explain the differences in BFDV prevalence or load between subpopulations. Overall, our analyses suggest that functional host responses to infection, or force of infection, differ between subspecies and hybrids. Our findings highlight the role of host hybridization and clines in altering host-pathogen interactions, dynamics that can have important implications for models of speciation with gene flow, and offer insights into how pathogens may adapt to diverging host populations."

Similarly, in cattle, PIV-3 is commonly associated with bovine respiratory disease complex. A novel dolphin PIV-3 (TtPIV-1) was described by Nollens et al. in 2008 from a dolphin that was diagnosed with an unknown respiratory illness. At that time, TtPIV-1 was found to be most similar to, but distinct from, bovine PIV-3 (BPIV-3). In the present study, similar viral growth kinetics and pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1Î², IL-6, and CXCL8) production were seen between BPIV-3 and TtPIV-1 in BEAS-2B, MDBK, and Vero cell lines. Initial nomenclature of TtPIV-1 was based on partial sequence of the fusion and RNA polymerase genes. Based on the similarities we saw with the in vitro work, it was important to examine the TtPIV-1 genome in more detail. Full genome sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis revealed that all six viral genes of TtPIV-1 clustered within the recently described BPIV-3 genotype B strains, and it is proposed that TtPIV-1 be re-classified with BPIV-3 genotype B strains."

In 2013-2015, blood and epithelial samples were collected from reported FMD outbreaks in four states (Kaduna, Kwara, Plateau and Bauchi) in northern Nigeria. FMDV non-structural protein (NSP) seroprevalence for the outbreaks was estimated at 80% (72 of 90) and 70% (131 of 188) post-outbreak. Antibodies against FMDV serotypes O, A, SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3 were detected across the states using solid-phase competitive ELISA. FMDV genome was detected in 99% (73 of 74) of the samples from FMD-affected animals using rRT-PCR, and cytopathic effect was found in cell culture by 59% (44 of 74) of these samples. Three FMDV serotypes O, A and SAT2 were isolated and characterized. The phylogenetic assessments of the virus isolates showed that two topotypes of FMDV serotype O, East Africa-3 (EA-3) and West Africa (WA) topotypes were circulating, as well as FMDV strains belonging to the Africa genotype (G-IV) of serotype A and FMDV SAT2 topotype VII strains. While the serotype O (EA-3) strains from Nigeria were most closely related to a 1999 virus strain from Sudan, the WA strain in Nigeria shares genetic relationship with three 1988 viruses in Niger. The FMDV serotype A strains were closely related to a known virus from Cameroon, and the SAT2 strains were most closely related to virus subtypes in Libya. This study provides evidence of co-occurrence of FMDV serotypes and topotypes in West, Central, East and North Africa, and this has implication for control. The findings help filling the knowledge gap of FMDV dynamics in Nigeria and West Africa subregion to support local and regional development of vaccination-based control plans and international risk assessment."

This could be explained either by a global similarity or a recombination event that brought primate herpesviral sequences into a bovine virus. Our sequences for DNA polymerase (U(L)30), a large gene adjacent to the previously identified conserved cluster, and glycoprotein G (U(S)4), a gene as distant from the cluster as possible on the circularized genome, confirm the close relationship between BoHV-2 and the primate simplexviruses, and argue for a global similarity and probably a close evolutionary relationship. Thus one can speculate that BoHV-2 may represent a greater hazard to humans than has been appreciated previously."

Morocco just faced its first H9N2 influenza virus outbreaks early 2016 affecting different types of poultry production. After its introduction, the virus spread very rapidly throughout the country. Samples were collected from 11 chicken flocks with high morbidity and mortality rates. Four viruses were successfully isolated from broiler chickens and one from broiler breeders and fully sequenced. Phylogenetic and molecular markers analyses showed the Moroccan viruses belonged to the G1 lineage and likely originated from the Middle East. As known for H9N2 viruses, the Moroccanisolates possess several genetic markers that enhance virulence in poultry and transmission to humans. The present study demonstrated that under field conditions H9N2 could have a devastating effect on egg production and mortalities and highlighted a lack of surveillance data on the pathogen in the region."

Rotavirus infection was initially detected using a rotavirus group A VP6 enzyme immunoassay; the P (VP4) and G (VP7) genotypes of the strain were identified by RT-PCR. We sequenced the VP7 gene and the VP8* portion of the VP4 gene and the strain displayed the strongest identity to the VP7 [>94% nucleotides (nt), >97% amino acids (aa)] and VP4 (>93% nt, >98% aa) sequences of PA169, a novel G6P[14] strain first isolated from a child in Italy during the winter of 1987. Additional sequencing and analysis of the other remaining structural (VP1-VP3, VP6) and non-structural (NSP1-NSP5) proteins support this animal-to-human reassortment theory. According to the full genome classification system, the G6P[14] strain (EGY3399) was assigned to G6-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A11-N2-T6-E2-H3 genotypes. The greatest similarity of EGY3399 NSP4 and NSP5 gene sequences were to those of ovine and simian origin, respectively. Coupled with other observations, our results suggest G6P[14] isolates rarely cause severe diarrhea in Egyptian children, and support other studies that indicate animal rotavirus contribute to the genetic diversity of rotavirus detected from humans through interspecies transmission and single or multiple segments reassortment."

Most AIV subtypes cause little or no disease in waterfowl, but outbreaks in poultry can be associated with high mortality. Although transmission of AIV to humans occurs rarely and is strain dependent, the virus has the ability to mutate or reassort into a form that triggers a life-threatening infection. The constant emergence of new influenza strains makes it particularly challenging to predict the behavior, spread, virulence or potential for human-to-human transmission. Because it is difficult to anticipate which viral strain or what location will initiate the next pandemic, it is difficult to prepare for that event. However, rigorous implementation of biosecurity, vaccination and education programs can minimize the threat of AIV. Global surveillance programs help record and identify newly evolving and potentially pandemic strains harbored by the reservoir host."

Although ovine RSV infects cattle, its contribution to bovine respiratory tract disease has not been established, which is an important issue for vaccine development in cattle. Diagnosis by virus isolation or serology has low or variable sensitivity and/or specificity and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been recommended as a rapid and sensitive technique for RSV detection. A simple procedure has been developed to detect and identify bovine and ovine RSVs. First, the nucleotide sequence of the ovine RSV fusion (F) gene was determined and compared with representative strains of bovine RSV and human RSV subgroups A and B. The ovine RSV F gene has 85 and 72â73% nucleotide identity with those of bovine RSV and human RSV, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence of the ovine RSV F gene has 94 and 83â84% amino acid identity with those of bovine RSV and human RSV, respectively. Then PCR primers targeting a specific F gene fragment of bovine and ovine RSV were designed. The primers represented bases 85â103 and the complementary sequence to bases 510â493 of the ovine RSV F gene. A similar PCR product (426 bp) was obtained on agarose gel electrophoresis from bovine RSV and from ovine RSV. The products, however, were unique to the parent virus and could be distinguished by EcoRI or MspI restriction endonuclease cleavage. EcoRI cleaved the ovine product into 2 bands (285 and 141 bp) but failed to affect the bovine RSV PCR product. However, MspI cleaved the bovine product into 2 bands (229 and 197 bp) but had no effect on the ovine product. Also, this assay did not amplify any PCR product with human RSV. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by restriction enzyme digestion is a useful and practical approach for detection and differentiation of ruminant respiratory syncytial viruses. </jats:p>"

Hidden Markov models (HMMs), decision trees and associative classification for each influenza A virus subtype and its major hosts (human, avian, swine) were generated. Features of the HA protein signatures that were host-and subtype-specific were sought. Host-associated signatures that occurred in different subtypes of the virus were identified. Evaluation of the classification models based on ROC curves and support and confidence ratings for the amino acid class-association rules was performed. Host classification based on the HA subtype achieved accuracies between 91.2% and 100% using decision trees after feature selection. Host-specific class association rules for avian-host origins gave better support and confidence ratings, followed by human and finally swine origin. This finding indicated the lower specificity of the swine host, perhaps pointing to its ability to mix different strains."

Subgroup A and B receptors are identified molecularly and their genomic positions TVA and TVB are mapped. The subgroup C receptor is unknown, its genomic locus TVC is reported to be genetically linked to TVA, which resides on chicken chromosome 28. In this study, we used two chicken inbred lines that carry different alleles coding for resistance (TVC(R) and sensitivity (TVC(S)) to infection by subgroup C viruses. A backross population of these lines was tested for susceptibility to subgroup C infection and genotyped for markers from chicken chromosome 28. We confirmed the close linkage between TVA and TVC loci. Further, we have described the position of TVC on chromosome 28 relative to markers from the consensus map of the chicken genome."

The aim of the present study was to identify and analyze nucleotides sequence of nucleoprotein (N) gene of rabies virus (RABV) from two cases of water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) bitten by a fox in Egypt, 2013. The diseased buffaloes showed nervous manifestations with fever. Specimens from brains of the buffaloes with suspected rabies were collected. RABV in collected samples was identified using direct fluorescent antibody (dFA) technique, histopathological examination and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Also, nucleotides sequence of partially amplified nucleoprotein (N) gene was compared with the other street strains of RABV available on GenBank. The results revealed that RABV antigen was identified in the brains of diseased buffaloes by dFA technique and the characteristic intracytoplasmic inclusions (Negri bodies) and RABV nucleic acid were detected by histopathology and RT-PCR, respectively. The identified virus showed close genetic relationship with street strains identified previously from dogs in different Governorates in Egypt and with strains identified in Israel and Jordan indicating transmission of the virus between Egyptian Governorates with a potential transmission from and/or to our neighboring countries."

We classified the BHV-1 strains according to these data as BHV-1.1, BHV-1.2 (a/b) and BHV-1.3 (a/b). BHV-1.1 and BHV-1.2 correspond to the well known 'common' BHV-1 strains, whereas BHV-1.3 has only recently been recognized and exhibits a neuropathogenic potential. In the present paper we describe the structural genome characteristics of BHV-1.3 compared to those of the other BHV-1 strains, examined by means of restriction site mapping, electron microscopy and cross-hybridization. Our results also confirm and complete data concerning BHV-1.1 and BHV-1.2 published by other authors. The following main conclusions can be drawn from our investigations: BHV-1.1 and BHV-1.2 differences are restricted to distinct genomic regions, characterized by loss or gain of restriction sites. BHV-1.3, however, differs from the other BHV-1 strains in restriction site alterations throughout the whole genome. Electron microscopy showed the typical BHV-1 DNA structure for BHV-1.3. Genetic homology between BHV-1.1 and BHV-1.2, reported to be about 95%, was confirmed by cross-hybridization, and a similar high base sequence homology for BHV-1.3 could be shown."

When human or animal cases are first recognised, molecular or serological diagnostic assays specific to them do not yet exist, causing a delay in the identification of an outbreak's aetiologic agent as well as its source. Preparing for the next virus to emerge is a major public health challenge, impeded by a poor understanding of the diversity of potential candidates that exist in wildlife reservoirs. Characterising the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species will help to reduce the time between detection and response in an outbreak situation, and inform public health strategies that reduce the risk of spillover from animal reservoirs. Pathogen discovery techniques such as consensus polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) have been used to identify known and novel viruses in animals and humans, but have not been widely used in surveillance programmes. Metagenomic studies have identified novel viruses, new strains of known viruses, and have characterised host microbiomes. While NGS represents an unbiased approach to viral sequence detection, it is constrained by lower sensitivity than conventional PCR, requires substantial bioinformatics capabilities, and is cost prohibitive and therefore not widely available in the regions of the world that are most vulnerable to zoonotic disease emergence. In contrast, consensus PCR uses standard and widely available technologies, has greater sensitivity than NGS, and has also been used to identify novel viruses in wildlife, livestock and humans, though it is limited to detecting target genetic sequences conserved across known groups of viruses. The use of cPCR, in combination, if possible, with NGS and serology, can offer a powerful approach to rapidly identifying aetiologic agents in an outbreak and characterising the virome of key wildlife known to carry zoonotic viruses. Here, the authors review pathogen discovery techniques currently being used in human and animal surveillance programmes and the challenges of using viral discovery to identify novel zoonotic pathogens. Les maladies Ã©mergentes sont souvent causÃ©es par des virus nouveaux ou prÃ©cÃ©demment inconnus, de portÃ©e zoonotique, qui ont gÃ©nÃ©ralement leur source dans la faune sauvage, Ã  partir de laquelle sâeffectue leur Ã©mergence. Lorsque le premier cas dâinfection par un virus de ce type est dÃ©tectÃ© chez lâhomme ou chez les animaux, il nâexiste encore aucune Ã©preuve molÃ©culaire ou sÃ©rologique de dÃ©tection de lâagent Ã©tiologique, ce qui retarde son identification ainsi que lâÃ©lucidation de la source du foyer. La prÃ©paration aux futures Ã©mergences virales est un vÃ©ritable dÃ©fi de santÃ© publique et se voit entravÃ©e par les lacunes des connaissances sur la diversitÃ© des virus potentiellement candidats. La caractÃ©risation des diffÃ©rents virus qui affectent les principales espÃ¨ces sauvages permettra de rÃ©duire le dÃ©lai entre le moment oÃ¹ un nouveau foyer est dÃ©tectÃ© et celui oÃ¹ une rÃ©ponse lui est apportÃ©e, et dâÃ©laborer en connaissance de cause des stratÃ©gies de santÃ© publique visant Ã  limiter le risque dâun franchissement dâespÃ¨ce Ã  partir des rÃ©servoirs animaux. Les techniques de dÃ©couverte dâagents pathogÃ¨nes, par exemple lâamplification en chaÃ®ne par polymÃ©rase (PCR) pan-gÃ©nÃ©rique ou consensus et le sÃ©quenÃ§age de nouvelle gÃ©nÃ©ration (SNG) sont utilisÃ©es pour identifier des virus connus ou nouveaux chez lâhomme et lâanimal, mais ne sont pas dâune utilisation courante dans les programmes de surveillance. Les Ã©tudes mÃ©tagÃ©nomiques permettent dâidentifier des virus nouveaux ainsi que les souches nouvelles de virus connus et servent Ã©galement Ã  caractÃ©riser le microbiome de lâhÃ´te. Le SNG constitue une mÃ©thode de dÃ©tection des sÃ©quences virales exempte de biais mais sa sensibilitÃ© moindre que celle des PCR classiques, les capacitÃ©s bio-informatiques considÃ©rables quâil requiert et son coÃ»t prohibitif sont des contraintes importantes qui en limitent lâutilisation dans les rÃ©gions du monde les plus vulnÃ©rables Ã  lâÃ©mergence des maladies zoonotiques. En revanche, la PCR consensus fait appel Ã  des technologies normalisÃ©es et largement disponibles, tout en prÃ©sentant une meilleure sensibilitÃ© que le SNG ; elle permet Ã©galement dâidentifier des virus nouveaux prÃ©sents dans la faune sauvage, chez les animaux domestiques ou chez lâhomme, bien quâelle ne dÃ©tecte que des sÃ©quences gÃ©nÃ©tiques cibles conservÃ©es dâun groupe connu de virus Ã  lâautre. Le recours Ã  la PCR consensus, si possible associÃ© aux techniques de SNG et Ã  la sÃ©rologie se rÃ©vÃ¨le une stratÃ©gie puissante qui permet dâidentifier rapidement les agents responsables dâun foyer et de caractÃ©riser le virome dâespÃ¨ces sauvages jouant un rÃ´le majeur en tant que rÃ©servoirs de virus zoonotiques. AprÃ¨s avoir passÃ© en revue les techniques de dÃ©couverte dâagents pathogÃ¨nes actuellement utilisÃ©es dans les programmes de surveillance des maladies animales et humaines, les auteurs font le point sur les enjeux de ces techniques pour lâidentification de nouveaux agents pathogÃ¨nes zoonotiques. La causa de las enfermedades emergentes reside muchas veces en virus zoonÃ³ticos de apariciÃ³n reciente o hasta entonces no descritos, que en general se originan y surgen en animales salvajes. Cuando se detectan los primeros casos en personas o animales aÃºn no existen pruebas especÃ­ficas de diagnÃ³stico, ya sea molecular o serolÃ³gico, y ello retrasa la identificaciÃ³n del agente etiolÃ³gico del brote y la determinaciÃ³n de su origen. Prepararse para el prÃ³ximo virus que vaya a aparecer es un gran objetivo de salud pÃºblica, lastrado en la prÃ¡ctica por el escaso conocimiento de la gran diversidad de posibles candidatos que moran en los reservorios de la fauna salvaje. La caracterizaciÃ³n de los diversos virus que existen en las principales especies de animales salvajes ayudarÃ¡ a reducir el lapso que media entre la detecciÃ³n y la respuesta en caso de brote y a fundamentar a partir de ahÃ­ estrategias de salud pÃºblica que reduzcan el riesgo de diseminaciÃ³n desde los reservorios animales. Hasta ahora las tÃ©cnicas de descubrimiento de patÃ³genos, como la reacciÃ³n en cadena de la polimerasa (PCR) de consenso (PCRc) o la secuenciaciÃ³n de prÃ³xima generaciÃ³n, han servido para identificar virus nuevos o ya conocidos en personas y animales, pero no se han aplicado de forma generalizada a los programas de vigilancia. Gracias a estudios de metagenÃ³mica se han podido detectar virus reciÃ©n aparecidos o nuevas cepas de virus ya conocidos y caracterizar los microbiomas de los organismos anfitriones. Aunque la secuenciaciÃ³n de prÃ³xima generaciÃ³n constituye un mÃ©todo exento de sesgos para detectar secuencias vÃ­ricas, adolece de una menor sensibilidad que la PCR convencional, exige una considerable capacidad de gestiÃ³n informÃ¡tica de datos biolÃ³gicos y tiene un costo prohibitivo, por lo que no suele aplicarse en las regiones del mundo que estÃ¡n mÃ¡s expuestas a la apariciÃ³n de enfermedades zoonÃ³ticas. La PCR de consenso, en cambio, reposa en tÃ©cnicas habituales y muy extendidas, ofrece mayor sensibilidad que la secuenciaciÃ³n de prÃ³xima generaciÃ³n y tambiÃ©n ha sido utilizada para identificar virus nuevos en personas o animales salvajes y domÃ©sticos, si bien solo permite detectar las secuencias genÃ©ticas Â«dianaÂ» conservadas de entre todos los grupos conocidos de virus. El uso de la PCRc, combinado con la secuenciaciÃ³n de prÃ³xima generaciÃ³n y tÃ©cnicas serolÃ³gicas cuando sea posible, puede ofrecer un potente mÃ©todo para identificar con rapidez los agentes etiolÃ³gicos de un brote y caracterizar el viroma de los principales animales salvajes de los que se sabe que son portadores de virus zoonÃ³ticos. Los autores pasan revista a las tÃ©cnicas de descubrimiento de patÃ³genos que se utilizan actualmente en los programas de vigilancia sanitaria y zoosanitaria y exponen las dificultades que presenta el uso del descubrimiento de virus para identificar nuevos patÃ³genos zoonÃ³ticos."

A larger deletion of 86 nucleotides is present in some viruses from South America and The Philippines. These deletions include the loss of one or two pseudoknot structures predicted in this region of the 5'-UTR. In addition, multiple point mutations have allowed the derivation of a phylogenetic tree which defines a grouping of isolates very similar to that derived from the capsid gene sequences of the same viruses. The study provides evidence that deletion (or addition) events must be very frequent during evolution of FMDV type C, since viruses which are phylogenetically very closely related (they belong to the same tree branch) may differ in the presence or absence of these deletions.

This method is recommended by animal health organizations as a standard test to detect antigenic differences (subtypes) between circulating influenza virus, vaccine- and/or reference- strains. However, significant discrepancies between reference antisera and field isolates have been observed during serosurveillance of influenza A viruses in pig and poultry farms. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of influenza virus genetic and antigenic drift on serologic testing using standard HI assays and reference reagents. Low pathogenic AI H5N2 viruses isolated in Mexico between 1994 and 2008 were used for phylogenetic analysis of AI hemagglutinin genes and for serologic testing using antisera produced with year-specific AI virus isolates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed significant divergence between early LPAI H5N2 viruses (1994 - 1998) and more recent virus field isolates (2002 - 2008). Results of the HI test were markedly influenced by the selection of the AI H5N2 virus (year of isolation) used as reference antigen for the assay. These analyses indicate that LPAI H5N2 viruses in Mexico are constantly undergoing genetic drift and that serosurveillance of AI viruses is significantly influenced by the antigen or antisera used for the HI test. Reference viral antigens and/or antisera need to be replaced constantly during surveillance of AI viruses to keep pace with the AI antigenic drift. This strategy should improve the estimation of antigenic differences between circulating AI viruses and the selection of suitable vaccine strains."

The fusion (F) protein plays a key role in virus pathogenesis, and it is also used for Newcastle disease virus classification. In this study, we determined the complete coding sequence of the F gene in new velogenic NDV isolates with an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of 1.8 and a mean death time (MDT) of 72 or 48Â h. Complete sequences of the F genes of new Iranian isolates were amplified and sequenced in both directions. These isolates were compared to 195 nucleotide sequences from GenBank (available as of 07/17/2016). A phylogenetic tree was constructed for the F gene, using MEGA6 software with statistical analysis based on 500 bootstrap replicates. Evolutionary distances revealed that the new virulent isolates from Iran belonged to genotype VII in a new distinct sub-genotype named VII-(j). This new sub-genotype showed 3% divergence from genotype VIId. Recombination analysis showed that these new isolates were not recombinant NDVs."

During the last two decades, reports on emerging human monkeypox outbreaks in Africa and North America, the increasing number of cowpox virus infections in cats, exotic animals and humans and cases of vaccinia virus infections in humans in South America and India reminded us that - beside the eradicated smallpox virus - there are other poxviruses that can cause harm to men. We start to learn that the host range of some poxviruses is way broader than initially thought and that mainly rodents seem to function as virus reservoir. The following review is aiming to provide an up-to-date overview on the epidemiology of zoonotic poxviruses, emphasizing orthopoxviruses. By outlining the current knowledge of poxvirus transmission, we hope to raise the awareness about modes of acquisition of infections and their proper diagnosis."

In Morocco, the first PPR outbreak was notified in 2008. Since then no cases were reported for seven years, probably due to three successive vaccination campaigns during 2008-2011 and close surveillance at the border areas. In June 2015, the disease re-emerged in Morocco, raising questions about the origin of the virus. The PPR virus was confirmed by qRT-PCR and virus was isolated from clinical samples on VeroNectin-4 cells. The disease was experimentally reproduced in Alpine goats using both sheep and goat derived outbreak isolates. Molecular characterization of the 2015 Moroccan PPR isolate confirmed the identity of the virus as lineage IV, closely related to the 2012 Algerian (KP793696) and 2012 Tunisian (KM068121) isolates and significantly distinct from the previous PPRV Morocco 2008 strain (HQ131927). Therefore this study confirms a new incursion of PPR virus in Morocco during 2015 and highlights the urgency of implementation of a common control strategy to combat PPR in Maghreb region in North Africa."

Porcine kobuvirus is endemic to pig farms and is not restricted geographically but, rather, is distributed worldwide. The complete genomic sequences of four porcine kobuvirus strains isolated during a diarrhea outbreak in piglets in the Gansu province of China were determined. Two of these strains exhibited variations relative to the traditional strains. The potential 3C/3D cleavage sites of the variant strains were Q/C, which differed from the Q/S in the traditional porcine kobuvirus genome. A  90-nucleotide deletion in the 2B protein and a single nucleotide insertion in the 3â²UTR were found in the variant strains. The VP1 regions of all four porcine kobuviruses in our study were highly variable (81%â86%). Ten common amino acid mutations were found specifically at certain positions within the VP1 region. Significant recombination sites were identified using SimPlot scans of whole genome sequences. Porcine kobuviruses were also detected in pig serum, indicating that the virus can escape the gastrointestinal tract and travel to the circulatory system. These findings suggest that mutations and recombination events may have contributed to the high level of genetic diversity of porcine kobuviruses and serve as a driving force in its evolution.</jats:p>"

In order to obtain a more exhaustive molecular characterization of the IBDV ITA genotype and speculate on its origin, genome sequencing of the field isolate IBDV/Italy/1829/2011, previously assigned to the ITA genotype, was performed, and the sequences obtained were compared to the currently available corresponding sequences. In addition, phylogenetic and recombination analyses were performed. Interestingly, multiple amino acid (AA) sequence alignments revealed that the IBDV/Italy/1829/2011 strain shared several AA residues with very virulent IBDV strains as well as some virulence markers, especially in the VP1 protein. Nevertheless, sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of several residues typical of IBDV strains at a low degree of virulence in the IBDV/Italy/1829/2011 strain.

So far, vaccination campaigns have been carried out using live attenuated vaccines that do not allow serological differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). Although this drawback is acceptable for wild boar, the use of marker vaccines would facilitate studies on disease and vaccination dynamics. Recently, the CSF marker vaccine candidate CP7_E2alf was assessed for oral immunization under laboratory conditions. Promising results prompted efforts to study the vaccine candidate under field conditions and in bait formulation. In this context, two oral vaccination campaigns were carried out with CP7_E2alf bait vaccines in two areas called 'faunistic-hunting farms' in the region of Umbria, Italy. One campaign was conducted using single vaccination, the second with the routinely employed double vaccination strategy. Both campaigns were carried out before concerted hunting actions were performed. Bait uptake, vaccine virus detection and antibody responses were assessed along with inspections upon gutting. As a comparator, seven wild boar were hand-fed with baits under laboratory conditions. In the field, bait uptake ranged from 63.7% to 98.7%, whereas antibody prevalence reached only 33.3-35.1%. The marker serology showed a strong influence of sample quality on the test outcome with a total of 85% of samples being classified correctly. Vaccine virus was not detectable. Under hand feeding conditions, six out of seven wild boar took up at least one bait, and five of them showed detectable antibody levels seven weeks after vaccination. These results were supplemented by stability tests. Appropriate stability of vaccine virus was shown both under field and laboratory conditions. In total, most results were in line with our expectations. However, optimization of the DIVA assay has to be attempted in the future."

The interaction between gH and gL has been confirmed in several human herpesviruses, such as Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV). In this paper, we studied the interaction between DEV gH and gL. Recombinant plasmids pEGFP-N-gH and pDsRED-N-gL were constructed successfully. Expressions of both DEV gH and gL were observed after incubation of COS-7 cells transfected with pEGFP-N-gH and pDsRED-N-gL plasmids after 12Â h, respectively. Also, the co-localization of a proportion of the gH and gL was detected in the cytoplasm of COS-7 cells after co-transfection for 24Â h. Then, pCMV-Flag-gL and pCMV-Myc-gH recombinant plasmids were constructed and co-transfected into COS-7 cells.

            , which has been tentatively classified as influenza D virus (IDV). Although isolated from sick animals, it is unclear whether IDV causes any clinical disease in cattle. To address this aspect of Koch's postulates, three dairy calves (treatment animals) held in individual pens were inoculated intranasally with IDV strain D/bovine/Mississippi/C00046N/2014. At 1 day postinoculation, a seronegative calf (contact animal) was added to each of the treatment animal pens. The cattle in both treatment and contact groups seroconverted, and virus was detected in their respiratory tracts. Histologically, there was a significant increase in neutrophil tracking in tracheal epithelia of the treatment calves compared to control animals. While infected and contact animals demonstrated various symptoms of respiratory tract infection, they were mild, and the calves in the treatment group did not differ from the controls in terms of heart rate, respiratory rate, or rectal temperature. To mimic zoonotic transmission, two ferrets were exposed to a plastic toy fomite soaked with infected nasal discharge from the treatment calves. These ferrets did not shed the virus or seroconvert. In summary, this study demonstrates that IDV causes a mild respiratory disease upon experimental infection of cattle and can be transmitted effectively among cattle by in-pen contact, but not from cattle to ferrets through fomite exposure. These findings support the hypothesis that cattle are a natural reservoir for the virus.

            A novel influenza virus, tentatively classified as influenza D virus (IDV), was identified in swine, cattle, sheep, and goats. Among these hosts, cattle have been proposed as the natural reservoir. In this study, we show that cattle experimentally infected with IDV can shed virus and transmit it to other cattle through direct contact, but not to ferrets through fomite routes. IDV caused minor clinical signs in the infected cattle, fulfilling another of Koch's postulates for this novel agent, although other objective clinical endpoints were not different from those of control animals. Although the disease observed was mild, IDV induced neutrophil tracking and epithelial attenuation in cattle trachea, which could facilitate coinfection with other pathogens, and in doing so, predispose animals to bovine respiratory disease.

In the 1970s, outbreaks of virulent ND were recorded in Brazil, and the strain APMV-1/Chicken/Brazil/SJM/75 (SJM) of NDV was isolated. This strain was characterized as highly pathogenic for chickens but not pathogenic for other bird species. Here we present the complete genome of NDV strain SJM and investigate the phylogenetic relationships of this virus with other NDV strains in terms of genome and proteins composition, as well as characterizing its evolution process. The NDV strain SJM is categorized as a velogenic virus and the complete genome is 15,192 nucleotides in length, consisting of six genes in the order 3'-NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5'. The presence of the major pathogenic determinant of NDV strains ((112)R-R-Q-K-RâF(117)) was identified in the Fusion protein of the NDV strain SJM. In addition, phylogenetic analysis classified the NDV strain SJM as a member of class II, genotype V, and indicates that this virus help us in the understanding of the evolutionary process of strains belonging to this genotype. This study contributes to the growing interest involving the characterization of NDV isolates to improve our current understanding about the epidemiology, surveillance and evolution of the pathogenic strains."

Sixteen subtypes of HA and nine of NA are known. Lately, the circulation of some subtypes (H7N7, H5N1) has been closely watched because of the epidemiological threat they present. This study assesses the potential of using gel-based microchip technology for fast and sensitive molecular subtyping of the influenza A virus. The method employs a microchip of 3D gel-based elements containing immobilized probes. Segments of the HA and NA genes are amplified using multiplex RT-PCR and then hybridized with the microchip. The developed microchip was validated using a panel of 21 known reference strains of influenza virus. Selected strains represented different HA and NA subtypes derived from avian, swine and human hosts. The whole procedure takes 10 hours and enables one to identify 15 subtypes of HA and two subtypes of NA. Forty-one clinical samples isolated during the poultry fall in Novosibirsk (Russia, 2005) were successfully identified using the proposed technique. The sensitivity and specificity of the method were 76% and 100%, respectively, compared with the 'gold standard' techniques (virus isolation with following characterization by immunoassay). We conclude that the method of subtyping using gel-based microchips is a promising approach for fast detection and identification of influenza A, which may greatly improve its monitoring."

Environmental changes and deforestation have severely influenced many ecosystems, intensifying the contact between wildlife and humans. In recent years, bats have been found to harbor a number of different viruses with zoonotic potential, as well as a great diversity of astroviruses, for which the question of zoonotic potential remains unanswered to date. Human astroviruses have been identified as the causative agent for diarrhea in children and immunocompromised patients. For a long time, astroviruses have been considered to be strictly species-specific. However, a great genetic diversity has recently been discovered among animal and human astroviruses that might indicate the potential of these viruses to cross species barriers. Furthermore, our knowledge about the tissue tropism of astroviruses has been expanded to some neurotropic strains that have recently been shown to be responsible for encephalitis in humans and livestock. This review gives an overview on what is known about astroviruses in bats, humans and livestock, especially bovines and pigs. Future research activities are suggested to unravel astrovirus infection dynamics in bat populations to further assess the zoonotic potential of these viruses."

This family of viruses comprises more than 300 members grouped into five genera: Orthobunyavirus, Phlebovirus, Hantavirus, Nairovirus, and Tospovirus. Several members of the Bunyaviridae family are responsible for fatal hemorrhagic fevers: Rift Valley fever virus (Phlebovirus), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (Nairovirus), Hantaan, Sin Nombre and related viruses (Hantavirus), and recently Garissa, now identified as Ngari virus (Orthobunyavirus). Here are reviewed recent advances in Rift Valley fever virus, its epidemiology, molecular biology and focus on recent data on the interactions between viral and cellular proteins, which help to understand the molecular mechanisms utilized by the virus to circumvent the host cellular response."

To investigate the circulation of IDV among pigs in Italy, in the period between June 2015 and May 2016, biomolecular and virological tests were performed on 845 clinical samples collected from 448 pig farms affected by respiratory distress located in the Po Valley. Serological tests were conducted on 3698 swine sera, including archive sera collected in 2009, as well as samples collected in 2015 from the same region. Viral genome was detected in 21 (2.3%) samples from 9 herds (2%), while virus was successfully isolated from 3 samples. Genetic analysis highlighted that Italian swine IDVs are closely related to the D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 cluster.

            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            <jats:p>Influenza viruses such as swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) virus (A(H1N1)pdm09) generate genetic diversity due to the high error rate of their RNA polymerase, often resulting in mixed genotype populations (intra-host variants) within a single infection. This variation helps influenza to rapidly respond to selection pressures, such as those imposed by the immunological host response and antiviral therapy. We have applied deep sequencing to characterize influenza intra-host variation in a transmission chain consisting of three cases due to oseltamivir-sensitive viruses, and one derived oseltamivir-resistant case.</jats:p>

            <jats:p>Oseltamivir-resistance was only detected after prophylaxis with oseltamivir, suggesting that the mutation was selected for as a result of antiviral intervention. The persisting oseltamivir-sensitive virus population in the case carrying resistant viruses suggests either that a small proportion survive the treatment, or that the oseltamivir-sensitive virus rapidly re-establishes itself in the virus population after the bottleneck. Moreover, the increased intra-host variation in the oseltamivir-resistant case is consistent with the hypothesis that the population diversity of a RNA virus can increase rapidly following a population bottleneck.</jats:p>

HEV infections are mainly associated with acute, self-limited, icteric hepatitis with an average mortality rate of 1%. Animal reservoirs are considered to play an important role in the maintenance of the virus and in the spread of HEV to humans. HEV-induced seroconversion was described in several species, however clinical hepatitis in animals has not been observed to date. HEV strains from animals are genetically closely related to human HEV isolates, which supports the opinions on the zoonotic transmission of the virus. In this expansive study the occurrence of HEV was investigated in Hungarian wild and domesticated animal samples. HEV RNA was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in liver samples of wild boars, roe deer, and deer. The investigations of domestic swine samples detected HEV in 39% of the investigated Hungarian pig farms. Simultaneous investigation revealed no definite difference between liver and faeces samples of domestic pigs in the frequency of HEV positivity. The highest (36%) incidence of HEV infection was found among the 11-16-week-old pigs. Samples from domestic cattle and rodents collected in pig farms, forests and meadows were tested negative for HEV RNA. Phylogenetic analysis of partial sequences amplified within the ORF1 and ORF2 regions of selected strains revealed that the detected viruses belong to three subgroups of the third genogroup of HEV, and are closely related to human and swine HEV strains detected in different countries. The investigations revealed widespread distribution of HEV in Hungarian wild ungulate and domesticated swine populations, with considerable genetic diversity among the strains."

This study describes the development and validation of two real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR) for the specific detection of Mass and BR genotypes in allantoic fluids and clinical samples. Genotype-specific primers, combined with a generic probe targeted to the S1 gene, originated Mass RT-qPCR and BR RT-qPCR-specific assays. Analytical sensitivity and linearity of these assays were determined in comparison with an IBV generic real-time RT-PCR based on the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR RT-qPCR). Mass RT-qPCR detected five Mass field isolates, three vaccine samples, and one coinfected sample (BR and Mass) while BR RT-qPCR detected 16 BR field isolates. Both assays were linear (R(2) > 0.98), reproducible, and as sensitive as the classical 5'UTR RT-qPCR used to detect IBV. In the analysis of 141 IBV clinical samples, 8 were positive for Mass RT-qPCR, 76 for BR RT-qPCR, and 2 for both assays. In the remaining 55 samples, 25 were positive only for 5'UTR RT-qPCR and 30 were negative for the three assays. In conclusion, both assays were able to detect Mass and BR genotypes, allowing rapid and easy IBV molecular typing from allantoic fluids and clinical samples."

This is particularly true for the Parvoviridae family. Genetic diversity studies of single stranded DNA viruses within this family have been largely focused on arthropod- and vertebrate-infecting species that cause diseases of humans and our domesticated animals: a focus that has biased our perception of parvovirus diversity. While metagenomics approaches could help rectify this bias, so too could transcriptomics studies. Large amounts of transcriptomic data are available for a diverse array of animal species and whenever this data has inadvertently been gathered from virus-infected individuals, it could contain detectable viral transcripts. We therefore performed a systematic search for parvovirus-related sequences (PRSs) within publicly available transcript, genome and protein databases and eleven new transcriptome datasets. This revealed 463 PRSs in the transcript databases of 118 animals. At least 41 of these PRSs are likely integrated within animal genomes in that they were also found within genomic sequence databases. Besides illuminating the ubiquity of parvoviruses, the number of parvoviral sequences discovered within public databases revealed numerous previously unknown parvovirus-host combinations; particularly in invertebrates. Our findings suggest that the host-ranges of extant parvoviruses might span the entire animal kingdom."

In vertebrates, LEP gene symbol is reserved for leptin, the key regulator of energy balance in mammals. Launching an extensive search for this gene in the genome data that was submitted to the public databases along with duck genome manuscript and extending this search to all avian genomes in the whole-genome shotgun-sequencing database, we were able to report the first identification of coding sequences capable of encoding the full leptin protein precursor in wild birds. Gene structure, synteny and sequence-similarity (up to 54% identity and 68% similarity) to reptilian leptin evident in falcons (Falco peregrinus and cherrug), tits (Pseudopodoces humilis), finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and doves (Columba livia) confirmed that the bird leptin was a true ortholog of its mammalian form. Nevertheless, in duck, like other domestic fowls the LEP gene was not identifiable. Lack of the LEP gene in poultry suggests that birds that have lost it are particularly suited to domestication. Identification of an intact avian gene for leptin in wild birds might explain in part the evolutionary conservation of its receptor in leptin-less fowls."

Phylogenetic studies suggest that it is a recently evolved genetic sublineage of the important human pathogen coxsackievirus B5 (CBV5), and in agreement with this, it has been shown to utilize the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) for cell entry. The 3.0-A crystal structure of strain UK/27/72 SVDV (highly virulent) reveals the expected similarity in core structure to those of other picornaviruses, showing most similarity to the closest available structure to CBV5, that of coxsackievirus B3 (CBV3). Features that help to cement together and rigidify the protein subunits are extended in this virus, perhaps explaining its extreme tolerance of environmental factors. Using the large number of capsid sequences available for both SVDV and CBV5, we have mapped the amino acid substitutions that may have occurred during the supposed adaptation of SVDV to a new host onto the structure of SVDV and a model of the SVDV/CAR complex generated by reference to the cryo-electron microscopy-visualized complex of CBV3 and CAR. The changes fall into three clusters as follows: one lines the fivefold pore, a second maps to the CAR-binding site and partially overlaps the site for decay accelerating factor (DAF) to bind to echovirus 7 (ECHO7), and the third lies close to the fivefold axis, where the low-density lipoprotein receptor binds to the minor group of rhinoviruses. Later changes in SVDV (post-1971) map to the first two clusters and may, by optimizing recognition of a pig CAR and/or DAF homologue, have improved the adaptation of the virus to pigs."

By determining the nucleotide sequence of the amplicon, a molecular typing method was developed. If isolate sequences were compared to DHAV 5'UTR sequences available in public databases, nucleotide identity was > or =94% with homologous serotype and < or =73% with heterologous serotypes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed monophyletic clustering of 5'UTR sequences of a homologous serotype, confirming the new classification of DHAV (serotype 1 and the two new serotypes recently described in Taiwan and South Korea, respectively) into three genotypes (A, B and C) defined by the capsid coding region. Analysis of the results showed that the primer pair should aid in the detection of DHAV, and that the amplicon sequence contains type-specific information and can be used for effective and rapid molecular typing. The molecular methods proved their utility through the detection and typing of DHAV directly from 28 liver specimens collected from dead ducklings during duck viral hepatitis outbreaks in different regions of China between 2001 and 2007. The results confirmed the presence of DHAV in all of the 28 samples and demonstrated that genotypes A (13/28) and C (15/28) of DHAV are co-circulating in China."

To elucidate the mechanism of IFN-Î³ anti FMDV infection in host cells, high-throughput RNA sequencing was analyzed for systemic changes in gene expression profiles in PK15 cells infected by FMDV with or without IFN-Î³ pretreatment. More than 25 million reads, covering 1.2-1.5 Gb, were analyzed from each experiment panel. FMDV challenge altered the transcription of genes involved in positively and negatively regulating cell death or apoptosis; however, the expected immune suppression response was not obvious. IFN-Î³ pretreatment combined with FMDV infection normalized the increase in apoptosis. Furthermore, the transcription factors required for IFN-Î³ functioning, STAT1 and IRF1 were up-regulated by IFN-Î³ pretreatment and stimulated downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These induced ISGs are mainly responsible for antigen processing, antigen presentation or antiviral defense. Interestingly, a synergistic effect on some ISGs, including OAS1, OAS2, MX1, MX2, RIG-I and IFIT1, was observed in the combined treatment compared to the IFN-Î³ treatment alone. The suggested effects identified by RNA sequencing were consistent with cellular morphology changes and confirmed by related protein markers. This is the first report exploring transcriptome alterations introduced by FMDV infection with or without IFN-Î³ pretreatment. The identified key host genes that control cell survival in vitro broaden our comprehensive understanding of how IFN-Î³ inhibits FMDV infection and may shed light on developing improved FMD control approaches."

Sun9 was also classified into P[14] and G8 in the phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the genome segments encoding VP4 and VP7. Although previous reports have suggested that P[14],G8 human RV-As isolated until now were obtained from the reassortment between human and bovine RV-As, or the interspecies transmission of bovine RV-A to human, no P[14],G8 bovine RV-A has yet been reported.

Control programs usually include vaccination with a modified live viral (MLV) vaccine. On occasion BoHV-1 strains are isolated from diseased animals or fetuses postvaccination. Currently there are no markers for differentiating MLV strains from field strains of BoHV-1. In this study several BoHV-1 strains were sequenced using whole-genome sequencing technologies and the data analyzed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Strains sequenced included the reference BoHV-1 Cooper strain (GenBank Accession JX898220), eight commercial MLV vaccine strains, and 14 field strains from cases presented for diagnosis. Based on SNP analyses, the viruses could be classified into groups having similar SNP patterns. The eight MLV strains could be differentiated from one another although some were closely related to each other. A number of field strains isolated from animals with a history of prior vaccination had SNP patterns similar to specific MLV viruses, while other field isolates were very distinct from all vaccine strains. The results indicate that some BoHV-1 isolates from clinically ill cattle/fetuses can be associated with a prior MLV vaccination history, but more information is needed on the rate of BoHV-1 genome sequence change before irrefutable associations can be drawn."

          <jats:p>Next-generation sequencing technology is now being increasingly applied to study the within- and between-host population dynamics of viruses. However, information on avian influenza virus evolution and transmission during a naturally occurring epidemic is still limited. Here, we use deep-sequencing data obtained from clinical samples collected from five industrial holdings and a backyard farm infected during the 2013 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N7 epidemic in Italy to unravel (i) the epidemic virus population diversity, (ii) the evolution of virus pathogenicity, and (iii) the pathways of viral transmission between different holdings and sheds. We show a high level of genetic diversity of the HPAI H7N7 viruses within a single farm as a consequence of separate bottlenecks and founder effects. In particular, we identified the cocirculation in the index case of two viral strains showing a different insertion at the hemagglutinin cleavage site, as well as nine nucleotide differences at the consensus level and 92 minority variants. To assess interfarm transmission, we combined epidemiological and genetic data and identified the index case as the major source of the virus, suggesting the spread of different viral haplotypes from the index farm to the other industrial holdings, probably at different time points. Our results revealed interfarm transmission dynamics that the epidemiological data alone could not unravel and demonstrated that delay in the disease detection and stamping out was the major cause of the emergence and the spread of the HPAI strain.</jats:p>

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            The within- and between-host evolutionary dynamics of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain during a naturally occurring epidemic is currently poorly understood. Here, we perform for the first time an in-depth sequence analysis of all the samples collected during a HPAI epidemic and demonstrate the importance to complement outbreak investigations with genetic data to reconstruct the transmission dynamics of the viruses and to evaluate the within- and between-farm genetic diversity of the viral population. We show that the evolutionary transition from the low pathogenic form to the highly pathogenic form occurred within the first infected flock, where we identified haplotypes with hemagglutinin cleavage site of different lengths. We also identify the index case as the major source of virus, indicating that prompt application of depopulation measures is essential to limit virus spread to other farms.

With the aim to classify the strain of virus identified, real-time PCR must be often supported by time-consuming capillary electrophoresis sequencing analysis. Here we provide a protocol for the rapid and reliable identification of 5 closely related herpesviruses by PyroMark Q24 sequencing system. PyroMark performs DNA sequencing analysis using pyrosequencing, a technology based on the detection of released pyrophosphate during DNA elongation [1]. PyroMark is designed to detect changes in specified variable positions of the DNA. It can efficiently detect single nucleotide differences in sequences [2]. In the present paper we describe a protocol to pyrosequence a small polymorphic segment of the US8 gene. On the basis of the differences identified in the nucleotide sequence we could readily classify the herpesvirus as Bovine herpesvirus 1.1, Bovine herpesvirus 1.2, Bovine herpesvirus 5, Bubaline herpesvirus 1 or Caprine herpesvirus. The protocol set up offers several advantages with respect to the techniques commonly used: â¢it requires less than one working day to be carried;â¢it gives the possibility to analyze, at reasonable costs, up to 24 samples at a time; andâ¢it allows to detect with great reliability and specificity strongly genetically correlated organisms like the herpesviruses named above. The procedure can be easily applied to other families of viruses, with opportune modifications."

Phenotypic characteristics of the six complementation  groups,"<jats:p>Fifty temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of the rhabdovirus Chandipura virus have been classified into six complementation groups designated ChI to ChVI. Group ChI contains 44 mutants, group ChII contains 2 mutants, and the remaining groups have 1 mutant each. Mutants in groups ChI, ChIII, ChIV, and ChVI had RNA-negative phenotypes in experiments measuring amplification of RNA synthesis at restrictive temperature. The two mutants in group ChII had RNA-positive phenotypes, and the virions were thermolabile. Mutant ts Ch851 of group ChV was also RNA positive, and the M polypeptide of this mutant appeared to be unstable in cells incubated at restrictive temperature. It is likely, therefore, that complementation groups ChII and ChV represent the genes coding for the two viral proteins of the virion envelope. No precise assignment can be made in the case of the four RNA-negative groups, since all the mutants examined showed some polymerase activity in vitro at restrictive temperature. An attempt to obtain polymerase mutants by screening for sensitivity to rifampin was not successful. Six temperature-dependent host range mutants (the tdCE phenotype) of Chandipura virus failed to multiply in chicken embryo cells at restrictive temperature, but otherwise they differed in their host range properties from similar mutants of vesicular stomatitis virus.</jats:p>"

The same major viral species were evidenced between batches of a given reagent but the proportion of viral reads among total reads varied markedly between samples (from 0.002% to 22.7%). In FBS, the sequences found were mainly from bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) 1 to 3 and bovine parvovirus 3 (BPV3). The BVDV sequences derived from FBS showed only minor discrepancies with primers generally used for the screening of BVDV. Viral sequences in trypsin were mainly from porcine circovirus type 2. Other known viral sequences at lower read counts and potential new viral species (bovine parvovirus and bovine pegivirus) were evidenced.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the strain clustered in genotype I of Class II ND viruses, has highly phylogenetic similarity to NDV strains isolated from waterfowl in China, but was distant from the viruses isolated in chickens and vaccine strains used in South Korea. Pathogenicity experiment in chickens revealed it to be a lentogenic virus. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cleavage site of the fusion (F) protein confirmed that the isolate contained the avirulent motif (112)GKQGRL(117) at the cleavage site and caused no apparent disease in chickens and ducks. With phylogeographic analysis based on fusion gene, we estimate the origin of an ancestral virus of the isolate and its sister strain located in China around 1998. It highlights the need of continuous surveillance to enhance current understanding of the molecular epidemiology and evolution of the pathogenic strains."

In this present study, we analyzed AS in REV-infected chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) which were inoculated with the second generation of REV (group VB) and compared with normal CEFs (group C) by high-throughput RNA sequencing technology.

On the other hand, TSE virus, which produces an LI-like disease in sheep, resembled LI virus in mouse neurovirulence tests. Molecular homology data of all the structural genes of TSE virus compared with other tick-borne flaviviruses demonstrated that TSE virus is a distinct member in the TBE virus subgroup. The data are consistent with the conclusion that TSE virus has evolved by a separate evolutionary pathway as compared with the close antigenic relatives, western European, far eastern TBE viruses and LI virus. By aligning the encoded amino acids in the viral envelope glycoprotein of mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses, we have also identified subgroup-specific pentapeptide motifs for the tick-borne encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis and dengue subgroup viruses of the genus Flavivirus.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with the differential expression of miRNAs during influenza A virus infection, we performed global miRNA and mRNA expression profiling in A549 cells infected with human-origin seasonal influenza A virus H3N2 (Human_Br07), swine-origin influenza A virus H1N1 (SW_3861) or avian-origin influenza A virus H3N2 (AVI_9990). The miRNA and mRNA expression profiles were obtained by microarray and high-throughput sequencing analyses, respectively. The integrated analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed using bioinformatics tools, and the expression of miRNAs and mRNAs was validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). We identified 20 miRNAs (6 upregulated and 14 downregulated) and 1286 mRNAs (935 upregulated and 351 downregulated) exhibiting the same differential expression trends in three infected groups of cells compared with an uninfected control. An integrated analysis of these expression profiles identified 79 miRNA-mRNA pairs associated with the influenza A reference pathway, and 107 miRNA-mRNA interactions were correlated with the defense of the virus.

          <jats:p>
            An H5N1 avian influenza A virus was transmitted to humans in Hong Kong in 1997. Although the virus causes systemic infection and is highly lethal in chickens because of the susceptibility of the hemagglutinin to furin and PC6 proteases, it is not known whether it also causes systemic infection in humans. The clinical outcomes of infection in Hong Kong residents ranged widely, from mild respiratory disease to multiple organ failure leading to death. Therefore, to understand the pathogenesis of influenza due to these H5N1 isolates, we investigated their virulence in mice. The results identified two distinct groups of viruses: group 1, for which the dose lethal for 50% of mice (MLD
            <jats:sub>50</jats:sub>
            ) was between 0.3 and 11 PFU, and group 2, for which the MLD
            <jats:sub>50</jats:sub>
            was more than 10
            <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>
            PFU. One day after intranasal inoculation of mice with 100 PFU of group 1 viruses, the virus titer in lungs was 10
            <jats:sup>7</jats:sup>
            PFU/g or 3 log units higher than that for group 2 viruses. Both types of viruses had replicated to high titers (&gt;10
            <jats:sup>6</jats:sup>
            PFU/g) in the lungs by day 3 and maintained these titers through day 6. More importantly, only the group 1 viruses caused systemic infection, replicating in nonrespiratory organs, including the brain. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the replication of a group 1 virus in brain neurons and glial cells and in cardiac myofibers. Phylogenetic analysis of all viral genes showed that both groups of Hong Kong H5N1 viruses had formed a lineage distinct from those of other viruses and that genetic reassortment between H5N1 and H1 or H3 human viruses had not occurred. Since mice and humans harbor both the furin and the PC6 proteases, we suggest that the virulence mechanism responsible for the lethality of influenza viruses in birds also operates in mammalian hosts. The failure of some H5N1 viruses to produce systemic infection in our model indicates that multiple, still-to-be-identified, factors contribute to the severity of H5N1 infection in mammals. In addition, the ability of these viruses to produce systemic infection in mice and the clear differences in pathogenicity among the isolates studied here indicate that this system provides a useful model for studying the pathogenesis of avian influenza virus infection in mammals.

Cattle, a major reservoir of the pathogen, harbor E. coli O157:H7 in their gastrointestinal tract and shed variable concentrations of E. coli O157:H7 into the environment. Genetic characterization of cattle-shed E. coli O157 strains is of interest to the livestock industry, food business, and public health community. The present study applied whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) and single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling to characterize 279 cattle-shed E. coli O157:H7 strains isolated from a single feedlot located in southwestern region of the US. More than 4,000 SNVs were identified among the strains and the resultant phylogenomic tree revealed three major groups. Using the Sakai strain genome as reference, more than 2,000 SNVs were annotated and a detailed SNV map generated. Results clearly revealed highly polymorphic loci along the E. coli O157:H7 genome that aligned with the prophage regions and highly variant genes involved in processing bacterial genetic information. The WGS data were further profiled against a comprehensive virulence factor database (VFDB) for virulence gene identification. Among the total 285 virulence genes identified, only 132 were present in all the strains. There were six virulence genes unique to single isolates. Our findings suggested that the genome variations of the E. coli O157:H7 were mainly attributable to dynamics of certain phages, and the bacterial strains have variable virulence gene profiles, even though they came from a single cattle population, which may explain the differences in pathogenicity, host prevalence, and transmissibility by E. coli O157:H7."

Since 1998, 10 other BTV serotypes have also been isolated from ruminants in the southeastern United States. In 2010, BTV-2 was identified in California for the first time, and preliminary sequence analysis indicated that the virus isolate was closely related to BTV strains circulating in the southeastern United States. In the current study, the whole genome sequence of the California strain of BTV-2 was compared with those of other BTV-2 strains in the Americas. The results of the analysis suggest co-circulation of genetically distinct viruses in the southeastern United States, and further suggest that the 2010 western isolate is closely related to southeastern strains of BTV. Although it remains uncertain as to how this novel virus was translocated to California, the findings of the current study underscore the need for ongoing surveillance of this economically important livestock disease."

The serum neutralization test was used to classify the viruses into serotype groups. Viruses which exhibited a difference of 20-fold or greater in neutralization titer were separated into different serotype groups.

From cross-protection studies, these serotype groups were found to be significantly different. With the exception of the porcine strain, none of the viruses used as vaccines protected gnotobiotic piglets from challenge with the virulent porcine Ohio State University strain of rotavirus. Furthermore, the canine virus protected piglets from challenge with the simian virus. The RNA electropherotype confirmed that the canine and simian strains were different in eight RNA segments and eliminated the possibility that they were the same virus.

In this study, five full-length circular ssDNA genomes were recovered from bat faecal samples using inverse PCR with sequences designed based on circovirus-related sequences obtained from Solexa sequencing data derived from a random amplification method. These five sequences shared a similar genomic organization to circovirus or the recently proposed cyclovirus of the family <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>. The newly obtained circovirus/cyclovirus-like genomes ranged from 1741 to 2177 bp, and each consisted of two major ORFs, ORF1 and ORF2, encoding putative replicase (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins, respectively. The potential stemâloop region was predicted in all five genomes, and three of them had the typical conserved nonanucleotide motif of cycloviruses. A set of primers targeting the conserved Rep region was designed and used to detect the prevalence of circovirus/cyclovirus sequences in individual bats. Among 199 samples tested, 47 were positive (23.6â%) for the circovirus genome and two (1.0â%) were positive for the cyclovirus genome. In total, 48 partial Rep sequences plus the five full-length genomes were obtained in this study. Detailed analysis indicated that these sequences are distantly related to known circovirus/cyclovirus genomes and may represent 22 novel species that belong to the family <jats:italic>Circoviridae</jats:italic>.</jats:p>"

This work describes the phylogenetic dynamics of H1NX based on the complete molecular characterization of eight genes of viruses that were collected from 2014 to 2015 in Anhui Province, China. Hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition tests were used to determine the hemagglutination (HA) activity of the HA subtypes. The entire genomes of the viruses were sequenced on an ABI PRISM 3500xl DNA Analyzer. The sequences were genetically analysed to study their genetic evolution using DNASTAR and MEGA 6. The pathogenic effects of the viruses were evaluated using mouse infection models. Seven strains of the H1 subtype avian influenza virus were isolated. Phylogenetic analysis indicated natural recombination of the H1 influenza viruses between the Eurasian lineage and the North American lineage. Some genes had high sequence identity with A/bean goose/Korea/220/2011(H9N2), which is a typical case involving viral reassortment between the Eurasian lineage and the North American lineage. The results of infection experiments in mice showed that the viruses could acquire the ability to multiply in mouse respiratory organs without adaptation. These findings suggest that continued surveillance of wild birds, particularly migratory birds, is important to provide early warning of possible H1 influenza epidemics and to understand the ecology of the virus."

We analyzed 506 avian specimens collected from poultry in live bird markets and backyard flocks to identify influenza A viruses. Virus isolation-positive specimens (n = 50) were subtyped and their coding-complete genomes were sequenced. The most frequently identified subtypes among LPAI isolates were H9N2, H11N3, H4N6, and H1N1. Less frequently detected subtypes included H1N3, H2N4, H3N2, H3N6, H3N8, H4N2, H5N2, H6N1, H6N7, and H7N9. Gene sequences were compared to publicly available sequences using phylogenetic inference approaches. Among the 14 subtypes identified, the majority of viral gene segments were most closely related to poultry or wild bird viruses commonly found in Southeast Asia, Europe, and/or northern Africa. LPAI subtypes were distributed over several geographic locations in Bangladesh, and surface and internal protein gene segments clustered phylogenetically with a diverse number of viral subtypes suggesting extensive reassortment among these LPAI viruses. H9N2 subtype viruses differed from other LPAI subtypes because genes from these viruses consistently clustered together, indicating this subtype is enzootic in Bangladesh. The H9N2 strains identified in Bangladesh were phylogenetically and antigenically related to previous human-derived H9N2 viruses detected in Bangladesh representing a potential source for human infection. In contrast, the circulating LPAI H5N2 and H7N9 viruses were both phylogenetically and antigenically unrelated to H5 viruses identified previously in humans in Bangladesh and H7N9 strains isolated from humans in China. In Bangladesh, domestic poultry sold in live bird markets carried a wide range of LPAI virus subtypes and a high diversity of genotypes. These findings, combined with the seven year timeframe of sampling, indicate a continuous circulation of these viruses in the country."

They have been used for diverse purposes such as for transcriptome analysis, CNV detection, SNP and CNV genotyping, studying DNA-protein interaction, and detection of genome methylation. Microarrays have also made invaluable contributions to research in chicken which is an important model organism for studying embryology, immunology, oncology, virology, evolution, genetics, and genomics and also for other avian species. Despite their huge contributions in life science research, the future of microarrays is now being questioned with the advent of massively parallel next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, which promise to overcome some of the limitations of microarray platforms. In this article we review the various microarray resources developed for chicken and their past and potential future applications. We also discuss about the future of microarrays in the NGS era particularly in the context of livestock genetics. We argue that even though NGS promises some major advantages-in particular, offers the opportunity to discover novel elements in the genome-microarrays will continue to be major tools for research and practice in the field of livestock genetics/genomics due to their affordability, high throughput nature, mature established technologies and ease of application. Moreover, with advent of new microarray technologies like capture arrays, the NGS and microarrays are expected to complement each other in future research in life science."

The continuing upward trajectory of sequencing technologies will improve livestock research and expedite the development of various new genomic and technological studies with farm animals. The use of high-throughput technologies in livestock research has increased interest in metagenomics, epigenetics, genome-wide association studies, and identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variations. Such studies are beginning to provide revolutionary insights into biological and evolutionary processes. Farm animals, such as cattle, swine, and horses, have played a dual role as economically and agriculturally important animals as well as biomedical research models. The first part of this study explores the current state of sequencing methods, many of which are already used in animal genomic studies, and the second part summarizes the state of cattle, swine, horse, and chicken genome sequencing and illustrates its achievements during the last few years. Finally, we describe several high-throughput sequencing approaches for the improved detection of known, unknown, and emerging infectious agents, leading to better diagnosis of infectious diseases. The insights from viral metagenomics and the advancement of next-generation sequencing will strongly support specific and efficient vaccine development and provide strategies for controlling infectious disease transmission among animal populations and/or between animals and humans. However, prospective sequencing technologies will require further research and in-field testing before reaching the marketplace."

Based on antigenic and nucleotide differences, BVDV are classified into two recognized species, BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. More recently, a new putative pestivirus species, tentatively called ""HoBi-like"", has been associated with bovine viral diarrhea. HoBi-like viruses were first identified in fetal bovine serum (FBS) imported from Brazil. Subsequently, a number of HoBi-like viruses have been detected as contaminants in FBS or cell culture and in live ruminants. To further investigate the possible pestivirus contamination in commercially available FBS batches, 26 batches of FBS with various countries of origin, were tested in this study for the presence of bovine pestiviruses. All the 26 batches were positive by RT-PCR for at least one species of bovine pestiviruses. HoBi-like viruses were detected in 15 batches. Analysis of the 5'UTR and N(pro) sequences of 15 newly identified HoBi-like viruses combined with analysis of additional sequences from GenBank, identified 4 genetic groups tentatively named 3a-3d. The current study confirmed the presence of the emerging HoBi-like viruses in FBS products labeled with different geographic origins. This finding has obvious implications for the safety of biological products, such cell lines and vaccines."

        <p>Viruses of prokaryotes (phages) are obligate microbial pathogens that can, in the lytic phase of development, infect and lyse their respective bacterial or archaeal hosts. As such, these viruses can reduce the population density of their hosts rapidly, and have been viewed as possible agents of biological control (phage therapy). Phage therapy is becoming increasingly important as a means of eradicating or controlling microbial populations as the use of antibiotics and chemical treatments becomes both less effective and less publicly acceptable. Phage therapy has therefore been raised as a potential strategy to reduce methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions from ruminants, providing an innovative biological approach, harnessing the potent, yet targeted, biocidal attributes of these naturally occurring microbial predators.</p>"

Utilization of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in outbreak analysis facilitates the rapid and accurate identification of virulence factors of the pathogen and can be used to identify the path of disease transmission within a population and provide information on the probable source. Molecular tools such as WGS are being refined and advanced at a rapid pace to provide robust and higher-resolution methods for identifying, comparing, and classifying pathogenic organisms. If these methods of pathogen characterization are properly applied, they will enable an improved public health response whether a disease outbreak was initiated by natural events or by accidental or deliberate human activity. The current application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to microbial WGS and microbial forensics is reviewed."

These viruses replicate by infecting new lymphocytes (i.e. the infectious cycle) or via clonal expansion of the infected cells (mitotic cycle). The relative importance of these two cycles in viral replication varies during infection. The majority of infected clones are created early before the onset of an efficient immune response. Later on, the main replication route is mitotic expansion of pre-existing infected clones. Due to the paucity of available samples and for ethical reasons, only scarce data is available on early infection by HTLV-1. Therefore, we addressed this question in a comparative BLV model. We used high-throughput sequencing to map and quantify the insertion sites of the provirus in order to monitor the clonality of the BLV-infected cells population (i.e. the number of distinct clones and abundance of each clone). We found that BLV propagation shifts from cell neoinfection to clonal proliferation in about 2 months from inoculation. Initially, BLV proviral integration significantly favors transcribed regions of the genome. Negative selection then eliminates 97% of the clones detected at seroconversion and disfavors BLV-infected cells carrying a provirus located close to a promoter or a gene. Nevertheless, among the surviving proviruses, clone abundance positively correlates with proximity of the provirus to a transcribed region. Two opposite forces thus operate during primary infection and dictate the fate of long term clonal composition: (1) initial integration inside genes or promoters and (2) host negative selection disfavoring proviruses located next to transcribed regions. The result of this initial response will contribute to the proviral load set point value as clonal abundance will benefit from carrying a provirus in transcribed regions."

Transcription of viral immediate early (IE) genes during alphaherpesvirus gene expression, is mediated by a multi-component immediate early complex (IEC) integrated by the viral tegument protein alpha trans-inducing factor (alpha-tif), a host cell protein (HCF), and a host Octamer protein (Oct). In this paper, we present a sequence analysis of the alpha-tif of the encephalitic BHV subtype, bovine herpesvirus type 5 (BHV-5). Bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) and BHV-5 alpha-tifs share 98% amino acid sequence homology. However, BHV-5 alpha-tif is 23 residues shorter at the amino terminus than BHV-1 alpha-tif. Amino acid alignment of the alpha-tifs of BHV-1 and BHV-5 with other alphaherpesviruses indicates areas of conserved motifs but also important differences located mainly at the amino and carboxyl termini."

Here we have examined the genetic relationships in LTR, pol and env surface unit (SU) and the growth patterns in goat (GSM) and sheep (FOS) synovial membrane cell cultures of SRLV isolates obtained from both mixed and single species herds. Phylogenetic analyses of pol and env SU revealed that Norwegian SRLVs derived from both goat and sheep in mixed herds are distributed into group C, while isolates obtained from unmixed sheep flocks cluster in group A, together with maedi-visna-like representatives of the A1 subtype. In this study, the direction of group C virus transmission is proposed to be from goat to sheep. The replication efficiency in GSM and FOS cultures and the cytopathic phenotype induced by the SRLV isolates gave no indication of any species-specific characteristics. No particular nucleotide sequences of the LTR-U3 region or env SU were identified that could be related to cytopathic phenotype. This study shows that sheep in Norway harbour SRLVs belonging to phylogenetic groups A and C, and this provides further evidence for cross-species infection being a regular characteristic of SRLVs, which may represent an important source for viral persistence."

This study reports the identification of 10 microRNA (miRNA) genes, Bhv1-mir-B1-Bhv1-mir-B10, encoded by the BoHV-1 genome that were processed into 12 detectable mature miRNAs as determined by ultra-high throughput sequencing bioinformatics analyses of small RNA libraries and expression studies. We found that four of the miRNA genes were present as two copies in the BoHV-1 genome, resulting in a total of 14 miRNA encoding loci. Unique features of the BoHV-1 miRNAs include evidence of bidirectional transcription and a close association of two miRNA genes with the origin of replication, including one miRNA that is encoded within the origin of replication. The miRNA gene Bhv1-mir-B5 was encoded on the opposite DNA strand to the latency associated transcript, potentially giving rise to antisense transcripts originating from this locus. The association of herpesvirus miRNAs with latency appears to be a common feature in the alphaherpesviruses. Analyses of the BoHV-5 genome for putative miRNA gene orthologues identified a high degree of evolutionary conservation for nine of the BoHV-1 miRNA genes. The possible roles for BoHV-1 miRNAs in the regulation of known BoHV-1 transcription units and the genetics of the BoHV-1 genotypes are also discussed."

These viruses spread rapidly to Europe and the North American continent during autumn 2014 and caused, in Germany, five outbreaks in poultry holdings until February 2015. In addition, birds kept in a zoo in north-eastern Germany were affected. Only a few individual white storks (Ciconia ciconia) showed clinical symptoms and eventually died in the course of the infection, although subsequent in-depth diagnostic investigations showed that other birds kept in the same compound of the white storks were acutely positive for or had undergone asymptomatic infection with HPAIV H5N8. An exception from culling all of the 500 remaining zoo birds was granted by the competent authority. Restriction measures included grouping the zoo birds into eight epidemiological units in which 60 birds of each unit tested repeatedly negative for H5N8. Epidemiological and phylogenetical investigations revealed that the most likely source of introduction was direct or indirect contact with infected wild birds as the white storks had access to a small pond frequented by wild mallards and other aquatic wild birds during a period of 10Â days in December 2014. Median network analysis showed that the zoo bird viruses segregated into a distinct cluster of clade 2.3.4.4 with closest ties to H5N8 isolates obtained from mute swans (Cygnus olor) in Sweden in April 2015. This case demonstrates that alternatives to culling exist to rescue valuable avifaunistic collections after incursions of HPAIV."

In Denmark, a passive surveillance program for IAV in pigs has been performed since 2011, where screening tests and subsequent subtyping are performed by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). A disadvantage of the current subtyping system is that several assays are needed to cover the wide range of circulating subtypes, which makes the system expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to develop a high-throughput method, which could improve surveillance of swine influenza viruses (swIAVs) and lower the costs of virus subtyping. Twelve qPCR assays specific for various hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene lineages relevant for swIAV and six assays specific for the internal genes of IAV were developed and optimized for the high-throughput qPCR platform BioMark (Fluidigm). The qPCR assays were validated and optimized to run under the same reaction conditions using a 48.48 dynamic array (48.48DA). The sensitivity and specificity was assessed by testing virus isolates and field samples with known subtypes. The results revealed a performance of the swIAV 48.48DA similar to conventional real-time analysis, and furthermore, the specificity of swIAV 48.48DA was very high and without cross reactions between the assays. This high-throughput system provides a cost-effective alternative for subtyping of swIAVs."

Previous in vitro co-infection experiments demonstrated prior or concurrent infection of Aedes albopictus C6/36 mosquito cells with NHUV resulted in a 10,000-fold reduction in viral production of West Nile virus (WNV). This interference between WNV and NHUV was observed herein in an additional Ae. albopictus mosquito cell line, C7-10. A WNV 2K peptide (V9M) mutant capable of superinfection with a pre-established WNV infection demonstrated a comparable level of interference from NHUV as the parental WNV strain in C6/36 and C7-10 cells. Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex pipiens mosquitoes intrathoracically inoculated with NHUV and WNV, or solely with WNV as a control, were allowed to extrinsically incubate the viruses up to nine and 14 days, respectively, and transmissibility and replication of WNV was determined. The proportion of Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes capable of transmitting WNV was significantly lower for the WNV/NHUV group than the WNV control at seven and nine days post inoculation (dpi), while no differences were observed in the Cx. pipiens inoculation group. By dpi nine, a 40% reduction in transmissibility in mosquitoes from the dual inoculation group was observed compared to the WNV-only control. These data indicate the potential that infection of some Culex spp. vectors with NHUV could serve as a barrier for efficient transmissibility of flaviviruses associated with human disease."

The present study was undertaken to determine how co-infection of a pathogenic MDV serotype one (MDV1) strain (MD5) and a vaccine strain (herpesvirus of turkeys [HVT]) alters viral miRNA expression in vivo. We first used small RNA deep sequencing to identify MDV1-encoded miRNAs that are expressed in tumorigenic spleens of MDV1-infected birds. The expression patterns of these miRNAs were then further assessed at an early time point (7 days postinfection [dpi]) and a late time point (42 dpi) in birds with and without HVT vaccination using real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Additionally, the effect of MDV1 co-infection on HVT-encoded miRNAs was determined using RT-PCR. A diverse population of miRNAs was expressed in MDV-induced tumorigenic spleens at 42 dpi, with 18 of the 26 known mature miRNAs represented. Of these, both mdv1-miR-M4-5p and mdv1-miR-M2-3p were the most highly expressed miRNAs. RT-PCR analysis further revealed that nine MDV miRNAs were differentially expressed between 7 dpi and 42 dpi infected spleens. At 7 dpi, three miRNAs were differentially expressed between the spleens of birds co-infected with HVT and MD5 compared with birds singly infected with MD5, whereas at 42 dpi, nine miRNAs were differentially expressed. At 7 dpi, the expression of seven HVT-encoded miRNAs was affected in the spleens of co-infected birds compared with birds only receiving the HVT vaccine. At 42 dpi, six HVT-encoded miRNAs were differentially expressed between the two groups. Target prediction analysis suggests that these differentially expressed viral miRNAs are involved in regulating several cellular processes, including cell proliferation and the adaptive immune response."

I generated DNA sequences for 16 isolates of pseudorabies virus at the glycoprotein C gene, from which I constructed phylogenetic trees. I then used these trees, in combination with parsimony-based analyses of character evolution, to infer the frequency and direction of interspecific transmission events. Comparing inferred frequencies and directions of transmission to null expectations based on 10,000 random trees indicated a significant excess of transmission events from pigs to pigs and a corresponding lack of transmission events from non-porcine species. These results are concordant with the know biology and natural history of pseudorabies virus, and they demonstrate that retrospective phylogeny reconstruction and analyses of character evolution can be used to investigate the transmission ecology of pathogens."

The high level of genetic identity (> 99.6%) between Seg2, Seg4 and Seg5 in all 8 BTV-24 isolates indicated that these segments shared the same viral ancestor. Phylogenetic analysis of Seg1, Seg3, Seg5, Seg8, Seg9, and Seg10 revealed that the Israeli BTV-24 strains comprised 4 variants. Five of the viruses revealed high identity among all 9 segments, and represented variant 1.

A third variant (BTV24/3027/1/10) showed signi cant variation from variant 1 in 6 segments (VP-1, VP-3, VP-6 and NS-1, NS-2 and NS-3 genes), while a fourth variant (BTV24/2214/1/10) showed signi cant variation from variant 1 in 4 segments (VP-1, NS-1, NS-2 and NS-3 genes). These marked di erences in sequence identity indicate that a high level of genetic reassortment is occurring between co-circulating BTV strains in Israel."

Previous studies have reported the prevalence of BVDV species and subgenotypes in cattle from the United States and Canada. We investigated the genetic diversity of BVDV strains detected in bovine serum samples from 6 different Mexican regions. Sixty-two BVDV isolates from Mexico were genetically typed based on comparison of sequences from the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the viral genome. Phylogenetic reconstruction indicated that 60 of the samples belonged to the BVDV-1 genotype and 2 to the BVDV-2 genotype. Comparison of partial 5'-UTR sequences clustered 49 samples within BVDV-1c, 8 samples within BVDV-1a, 3 samples within BVDV-1b, and 2 samples clustered with the BVDV-2a subgenotypes. Our study, combined with information previously published on BVDV field strain diversity in the United States and Canada, benefits the development of effective detection assays, vaccines, and control programs for North America."

In China, cattle are often infected with BVDV of different genotypes, but there is very limited knowledge regarding BVDV infection in Chinese yaks and the genetic diversity of the virus. The objectives of this study were to detect viral infection in yaks in Qinghai, China and to determine the genotypes of BVDV based on analysis of the 5'untranslated region (5'UTR) and N-terminal protease (N(pro)) region. Between 2010 and 2012, 407 blood samples were collected from yaks with or without clinical signs in six counties of Qinghai Province. Ninety-eight samples (24%) were found to be positive by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting a conserved region of BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. The nucleotide sequences of the 5'UTR and complete N(pro) region were determined for 16 positive samples. Phylogenetic reconstructions demonstrated that all 16 samples belong to subgenotypes BVDV-1b, BVDV-1d and BVDV-1q. This study provides, for the first time, molecular evidence for BVDV infection in yaks in Qinghai involving multiple subgenotypes of BVDV-1. This may have occurred under three possible scenarios: interspecies transmission, natural infection, and the use of vaccines contaminated with BVDV. The results have important implications for yak production and management in China, and specifically indicate that unscientific vaccination practices should be stopped and bio-security increased."

Epidemics usually occur when health systems are unprepared. During an unexpected epidemic, health authorities engage in damage control, fear drives action, and the desire to understand the threat is greatest. As humanity recovers, policy-makers seek scientific expertise to improve their ""preparedness"" to face future events.Global spread of disease is exemplified by the spread of yellow fever from Africa to the Americas, by the spread of dengue fever through transcontinental migration of mosquitos, by the relentless influenza virus pandemics, and, most recently, by the unexpected emergence of Ebola virus, spread by motorbike and long haul carriers. Other pathogens that are remarkable for their epidemic expansions include the arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers and hantavirus diseases carried by rodents over great geographic distances and the arthropod-borne viruses (West Nile, chikungunya and Zika) enabled by ecology and vector adaptations. Did we learn from the past epidemics? Are we prepared for the worst?The ultimate goal is to develop a resilient global health infrastructure. Besides acquiring treatments, vaccines, and other preventive medicine, bio-surveillance is critical to preventing disease emergence and to counteracting its spread. So far, only the western hemisphere has a large and established monitoring system; however, diseases continue to emerge sporadically, in particular in Southeast Asia and South America, illuminating the imperfections of our surveillance. Epidemics destabilize fragile governments, ravage the most vulnerable populations, and threaten the global community.Pandemic risk calculations employ new technologies like computerized maintenance of geographical and historical datasets, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Next Generation sequencing, and Metagenomics to trace the molecular changes in pathogens during their emergence, and mathematical models to assess risk. Predictions help to pinpoint the hot spots of emergence, the populations at risk, and the pathogens under genetic evolution. Preparedness anticipates the risks, the needs of the population, the capacities of infrastructure, the sources of emergency funding, and finally, the international partnerships needed to manage a disaster before it occurs. At present, the world is in an intermediate phase of trying to reduce health disparities despite exponential population growth, political conflicts, migration, global trade, urbanization, and major environmental changes due to global warming. For the sake of humanity, we must focus on developing the necessary capacities for health surveillance, epidemic preparedness, and pandemic response."

Samples from two nationwide surveys conducted in 2010 and 2011 were tested using virological (rRT-PCR and virus isolation) and serological (ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition) assays to detect IAV. Influenza A virus was detected in 15.7% of the sampled pigs (30.6% of herds) in 2010 and in 11.7% (24.2% of herds) in 2011. The percentage of seropositive pigs was 10.6% (16.1% of herds) and 1.4% (3.1% of herds) for each year, respectively. Three pandemic H1N1 and one seasonal human-like H3N2 viruses were isolated. Antibodies against viruses from different genetic clusters were detected. No reassortant strains with swine viruses were detected. The H3N2 virus was closely related to human viruses that circulated in Central America in 2010, distinct to the most recent human seasonal vaccine lineages. Spatial clusters of rRT-PCR positive herds were detected each year by scan statistics. Our results demonstrate circulation of IAV throughout Guatemala and identify commercial farms, animal health status, and age as potential risk factors associated with IAV infection and exposure. Detection of human-origin viruses in pigs suggests a role for humans in the molecular epidemiology of IAV in swine in Guatemala and evidences gaps in local animal and human surveillance."

We isolated and characterized seven ND viruses from vaccinated commercial poultry farms during severe disease outbreaks in Tamil Nadu, in Southern India, between April 2015 and June 2016. All the seven isolates were categorized as virulent by mean death time (48-54Â hr) in embryonated chicken eggs. Also, their sequences carried the virulence signature of multi-basic amino acid residues in their fusion protein cleavage site (RRQ/RR/KRF). Phylogenetic and evolutionary distance analyses revealed circulation of a novel sub-genotype of genotype XIII, class II ND viruses, herein proposed as sub-genotype XIIIe. The genetic divergence between the circulating virulent strains and the vaccine strains could possibly explain the disease outbreak in the vaccinated flocks. Further, our study signifies the need to implement routine epidemiological surveillance and to revisit the current vaccination program."

Vaccination for smallpox in humans and rinderpest in cattle was the basis for disease eradication, and recent progress in polio eradication is promising. Although early vaccines were developed empirically by passage in live animals or eggs, more recent vaccines have been developed because of the advent of new technologies, particularly cell culture and molecular biology. Recent technological advances in gene delivery and expression, nanoparticles, protein manufacturing, and adjuvants have created the potential for new vaccine platforms that may provide solutions for vaccines against viral pathogens for which no interventions currently exist. In addition, the technological convergence of human monoclonal antibody isolation, structural biology, and high-throughput sequencing is providing new opportunities for atomic-level immunogen design. Selection of human monoclonal antibodies can identify immunodominant antigenic sites associated with neutralization and provide reagents for stabilizing and solving the structure of viral surface proteins. Understanding the structural basis for neutralization can guide selection of vaccine targets. Deep sequencing of the antibody repertoire and defining the ontogeny of the desired antibody responses can reveal the junctional recombination and somatic mutation requirements for B-cell recognition and affinity maturation. Collectively, this information will provide new strategic approaches for selecting vaccine antigens, formulations, and regimens. Moreover, it creates the potential for rational vaccine design and establishing a catalogue of vaccine technology platforms that would be effective against any given family or class of viral pathogens and improve our readiness to address new emerging viral threats."

This has largely been attributed to the occurrence of a variety of known and ""unknown"", emerging novel diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated that colonies often can harbour more than one pathogen, making identification of etiological agents with classical methods difficult. By employing an unbiased metagenomic approach, which allows the detection of both unexpected and previously unknown infectious agents, the detection of three viruses, Aphid Lethal Paralysis Virus (ALPV), Israel Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV), and Lake Sinai Virus (LSV), in honeybees from Spain is reported in this article. The existence of a subgroup of ALPV with the ability to infect bees was only recently reported and this is the first identification of such a strain in Europe. Similarly, LSV appear to be a still unclassified group of viruses with unclear impact on colony health and these viruses have not previously been identified outside of the United States. Furthermore, our study also reveals that these bees carried a plant virus, Turnip Ringspot Virus (TuRSV), potentially serving as important vector organisms. Taken together, these results demonstrate the new possibilities opened up by high-throughput sequencing and metagenomic analysis to study emerging new diseases in domestic and wild animal populations, including honeybees."

Colinearity of genes was observed with the KSHV genome, and the core herpesvirus genes had strong sequence homology to the corresponding KSHV genes. RFHVMn lacked homologs of open reading frame 11 (ORF11) and KSHV ORFs K5 and K6, which appear to have been generated by duplication of ORFs K3 and K4 after the divergence of KSHV and RFHV. RFHVMn contained positional homologs of all other unique KSHV genes, although some showed limited sequence similarity. RFHVMn contained a number of candidate microRNA genes. Although there was little sequence similarity with KSHV microRNAs, one candidate contained the same seed sequence as the positional homolog, kshv-miR-K12-10a, suggesting functional overlap. RNA transcript splicing was highly conserved between RFHVMn and KSHV, and strong sequence conservation was noted in specific promoters and putative origins of replication, predicting important functional similarities. Sequence comparisons indicated that RFHVMn and KSHV developed in long-term synchrony with the evolution of their hosts, and both viruses phylogenetically group within the RV1 lineage of Old World primate rhadinoviruses. RFHVMn is the closest homolog of KSHV to be completely sequenced and the first sequenced RV1 rhadinovirus homolog of KSHV from a nonhuman Old World primate. The strong genetic and sequence similarity between RFHVMn and KSHV, coupled with similarities in biology and pathology, demonstrate that RFHVMn infection in macaques offers an important and relevant model for the study of KSHV in humans."

Using nasopharyngeal swabs collected during the earliest stages of the pandemic in Mexico, Canada, and the United States (n = 17), the Virochip was able to detect a novel virus most closely related to swine influenza viruses without a priori information. Deep sequencing yielded reads corresponding to 2009 H1N1 influenza in each sample (percentage of aligned sequences corresponding to 2009 H1N1 ranging from 0.0011% to 10.9%), with up to 97% coverage of the influenza genome in one sample. Detection of 2009 H1N1 by deep sequencing was possible even at titers near the limits of detection for specific RT-PCR, and the percentage of sequence reads was linearly correlated with virus titer. Deep sequencing also provided insights into the upper respiratory microbiota and host gene expression in response to 2009 H1N1 infection. An unbiased analysis combining sequence data from all 17 outbreak samples revealed that 90% of the 2009 H1N1 genome could be assembled de novo without the use of any reference sequence, including assembly of several near full-length genomic segments. These results indicate that a streamlined metagenomics detection strategy can potentially replace the multiple conventional diagnostic tests required to investigate an outbreak of a novel pathogen, and provide a blueprint for comprehensive diagnosis of unexplained acute illnesses or outbreaks in clinical and public health settings."

            <jats:p>A pool of 141 pediatric gastroenteritis samples that were previously found to be negative for known diarrheal viruses was subjected to pyrosequencing. From a total of 937,935 sequence reads, a collection of 849 reads distantly related to Aichi virus were assembled and found to comprise 75% of a novel picornavirus genome. The complete genome was subsequently cloned and found to share 52.3% nucleotide pairwise identity and 38.9% amino acid identity to Aichi virus. The low level of sequence identity suggests a novel picornavirus genus which we have designated klassevirus. Blinded screening of 751 stool specimens from both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals revealed a second positive case of klassevirus infection, which was subsequently found to be from the index case's 11-month old twin.</jats:p>

Yet, this information is essential for surveillance of animal and public health, vaccine updates, and for understanding virus evolution and its large-scale spread. The study population consisted of 21 swine herds with clinical problems due to respiratory disease. Nasal swabs from individual pigs were collected and tested by virus isolation in MDCK cells and by rtRT-PCR. All eight segments of 10 H3N2 viruses were sequenced using high-throughput sequencing and molecularly characterized. Within-herd prevalence ranged between 2 and 100%. Structurally, Ontario H3N2 viruses could be classified into three different groups. Group 1 was the most similar to the original trH3N2 virus from 2005. Group 2 was the most similar to the Ontario turkey H3N2 isolates with PB1 and NS genes originating from trH3N2 virus and M, PB2, PA and NP genes originating from the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. All Group 3 internal genes were genetically related to A(H1N1)pdm09. Analysis of antigenic sites of HA1 showed that Group 1 had 8 aa changes within 4 antigenic sites, A(1), B(3), C(2) and E(2). The Group 2 viruses had 8 aa changes within 3 antigenic sites A(3), B(3) and C(2), while Group 3 viruses had 4 aa changes within 3 antigenic sites, B(1), D(1) and E(2), when compared to the cluster IV H3N2 virus [A/swine/Ontario/33853/2005/(H3N2)]. The characterization of the Ontario H3N2 viruses clearly indicates reassortment of gene segments between the North American swine trH3N2 from cluster IV and the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus."

High throughput sequencing was used to obtain the complete coding sequence from five samples. An in-frame insertion was observed within the HEV hypervariable region in two samples. To interrogate whether this mutation may be the cause of high-level viraemia and faecal shedding as observed in the sampled pigs virus isolation and culture was conducted. Based on viral growth kinetics there was no evidence that these insertions affected replication efficiency in vitro, suggesting as yet undetermined host factors may affect the course of infection and consequently the risk of foodborne transmission."

Since 2013, the autopsy lesions, histological examinations, virus isolation, phylogenetic analysis and selection pressure analysis of the gE gene of vPRV were recorded for 395 clinical cases, and 5,033 pig serum samples were detected by PRV gE-coated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The major clinical symptoms were abortion in pregnant sows, fatal neurological signs in piglets and respiratory disease in growing pigs. Necrotic splenitis, hepatitis and lymphadenitis, haemorrhagic nephritis and non-suppurative encephalitis were observed by histopathological examination. Typical eosinophilic inclusion bodies were found in the nuclei of liver cells. Using PCR, 110 samples among 395 clinical cases tested positive for the gE gene. Fifteen vPRV strains were isolated and confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the gE gene. The strains shared 97.1%-99.9% nucleotide (nt) and 96.6%-99.5% amino acid (aa) homology with PRV reference strains. Selection pressure analysis showed that one site in the codons of glycoprotein E was under positive selection. Of the 5,033 serum samples, 2,909 were positive by ELISA for a positive rate of 57.8%. These results showed that vPRV was still prevalent in Shandong Province, indicating severe PRV infectious pressure. The preparation of new vaccines against PRV is extremely urgent."

De novo assembly revealed genomes of an enterovirus and an astrovirus and contigs of circoviruses and genogroup I picobirnaviruses. Complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that Sichuan takin enterovirus is a novel serotype/genotype of the species Enterovirus G, with evidence of recombination. Sichuan takin astrovirus is a new subtype of bovine astrovirus, probably belonging to a new genogroup in the genus Mamastrovirus.

Here, we identified lncRNAs transcribed from pseudorabies virus (PRV)-infected PK-15 cells. Based on high-throughput sequencing data, we obtained 87,263,926 and 93,947,628 clean reads from mock-infected and PRV-infected PK-15 cells, respectively. Through a normalized analytic protocol, we identified three novel viral lncRNAs. According to an analysis of differential expression between the mock-infected and PRV-infected cells, 4151 host lncRNAs were significantly upregulated and 2327 host lncRNAs were significantly downregulated in the latter group. Viral lncRNAs and several host lncRNAs were verified by northern blotting and real-time PCR. The findings showed that the viral lncRNA LDI might regulate the expression of IE180, a potent transcriptional activator of viral genes. Furthermore, we characterized the expression of viral lncRNAs in a culture of infected primary chicken dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Collectively, the obtained data suggest that PRV generates lncRNAs in both epithelial cells and chick DRG neurons."

Six putative open reading frames (ORFs) were identified, including Rep, capsid (Cap) and four proteins of unknown function. Both the genome size and the number as well as the organization of encoded ORFs, Bo-Circo-like virus CH is most closely related to Po-Circo-like virus 21 detected in pig faeces. A preliminary survey using specific primers for the Rep region showed that 5.3% (4/75) of diarrheic samples were positive for Bo-Circo-like virus, and all 42 healthy samples were negative. In conclusion, our results indicate that Bo-Circo-like virus CH may represent a new virus in bovine.

However, in recent years many cases of vaccine failure have been reported worldwide as chickens develop symptoms of MD in spite of proper vaccination. Distinct polymorphism and point mutations in Meq gene of MDV have been reported to be associated with virulence and oncogenicity. The present study was carried out with the objective to isolate and characterize field isolates of MDV on the basis of Meq gene. Twenty five samples of suspected cases of MD were collected and processed for virus isolation in duck embryo fibroblast (DEF) primary culture where 28% (7 of 25) samples showed characteristic cytopathic effects of MDV in the form of plaques and syncytia. Additional evidence of presence of MDV in these samples was confirmed by PCR. To analyze diversity in all seven isolates of MDV, a polymorphism study was carried out by cloning and sequencing of full length of Meq gene (1020Â bp). Sequence homology of 7 isolates with 23 reference strains showed 98.10-99.40% similarity in nucleotide and 95.90-98.50% similarity in amino acid sequences. Six isolates revealed 5 repeat sequences of 4 prolines (PPPP) whereas, one isolate revealed only 4 repeats. In phylogenetic analysis, these isolates formed a separate cluster showing close relatedness to the Chinese isolates. The study indicates a high mutation rate in field isolates of MDV that may be probable cause of vaccination failure."

We have determined the three-dimensional structures of the haemagglutinins (HAs) from H5 avian and H9 swine viruses closely related to the viruses isolated from humans in Hong Kong. We have compared them with known structures of the H3 HA from the virus that caused the 1968 H3 pandemic and of the HA--esterase--fusion (HEF) glycoprotein from an influenza C virus. Structure and sequence comparisons suggest that HA subtypes may have originated by diversification of properties that affected the metastability of HAs required for their membrane fusion activities in viral infection."

Genomics tools such as high-throughput sequencing, mRNA expression profiling, and microarray-based analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms are providing unprecedented ways to analyze the diversity of the genomes of emerging pathogens as well as the molecular basis of the host response to them. By comparing and contrasting the outcomes of an emerging infection with those of closely related pathogens in different but related host species, we can further delineate the various host pathways determining the outcome of zoonotic transmission and adaptation to the newly invaded species. The ultimate challenge is to link pathogen and host genomics data with biological outcomes of zoonotic transmission and to translate the integrated data into novel intervention strategies that eventually will allow the effective control of newly emerging infectious diseases."

In-depth phylogenetic analyses which included full-length genomic sequences of the viruses involved were performed to elucidate possible origins of incursions and transmission pathways. Tree reconstructions as well as host-shift and ancestral area inferences were conducted in a maximum likelihood framework. All viruses belonged to a separate subgroup (termed ""EMA-3"") within clade 2.2, and, thus, were distinct from two lineages of HPAIV H5N1 viruses (termed ""EMA-1"" and ""EMA-2"") present in the same geographic area in 2006. Analysis of concatenated coding regions of all eight genome segments significantly improved resolution and robustness of the reconstructed phylogenies as compared to single gene analyses. At the same time, the methodological limits to establish retrospectively transmission networks in a comparatively small geographic region and spanning a short period of time became evident when only few corroborating field-epidemiological data are available. Ambiguities remained concerning the origin of the EMA-3 viruses from a region covering Southeast Germany and the Czech Republic as well as routes of spread to other European countries. AIV monitoring programmes in place for wild birds and poultry in these countries did not reveal presence of these viruses in either population. Host switches between domestic poultry and wild bird populations occurred several times. Analysis of outbreaks in Northeast Germany and nearby Northern Poland in December 2007 demonstrated that geographic and even temporal vicinity of outbreaks does not necessarily indicate a common source of incursion."

No specific causal agents have been identified, and exposures to several chemicals have been examined and found to be unrelated. Evidence suggests a biological aetiology as the risk is highest for workers who are exposed to live animals or to biological material containing animal faeces, urine or blood. To investigate possible biological exposures in animal slaughterhouses, we used a metagenomic approach to characterise the profile of organisms present within an aerosol sample. An assessment of aerosol exposures for individual workers was achieved by the collection of personal samples that represent the inhalable fraction of dust/bioaerosol in workplace air in both cattle and sheep slaughterhouses. Two sets of nine personal aerosol samples were pooled for the cattle processing and sheep processing areas respectively, with a total of 332,677,346 sequence reads and 250,144,492 sequence reads of 85 bp in length produced for each. Eukaryotic genome sequence was found in both sampling locations, and bovine, ovine and human sequences were common. Sequences from WU polyomavirus and human papillomavirus 120 were detected in the metagenomic dataset from the cattle processing area, and these sequences were confirmed as being present in the original personal aerosol samples. This study presents the first metagenomic description of personal aerosol exposure and this methodology could be applied to a variety of environments. Also, the detection of two candidate viruses warrants further investigation in the setting of occupational exposures in animal slaughterhouses."

However, traditional statistical approaches may miss important features of BVD epidemiology due to the highly correlated nature of many farm-level risk factors. In this cross-sectional study, we used data collected from 304 cattle herds in New Zealand during 2015/2016 to compare the results from multivariable logistic regression with Bayesian network (BN) analysis. Blood samples from 15 heifers from each farm were pooled and analysed with an antibody ELISA test to classify BVD virus exposure status. Farmers were surveyed about their general management practices, knowledge about BVD, and risk factors for disease transmission, including onto- and off-farm movements, within- and between-farm contacts, and whether they implemented BVD control measures for their service bulls. Multiple imputation was used to infer missing values in the dataset prior to statistical analysis. The results showed that 57/116 (49.1%) beef farms and 95/188 (50.5%) dairy farms were likely to be actively infected with BVD virus. Almost 60% of farms had movements of heifers/cows onto the premises and 13.8% of farmers reported contact with cattle from other farms. The results of the multivariable logistic regression showed that farms where heifers/cows had been moved onto the premises during all or most of the past five years were at higher risk of being BVD seropositive than farms without those movements (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.29-4.24). Farms where cattle had occasional or rare contacts with cattle on other farms were also at increased risk compared with farms without any animal contacts between farms (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.33-5.41) although this association was not frequency-dependent. Only close animal contacts between farms was directly associated with BVD status in the BN model, however, this approach further untangled other complex associations between correlated management factors, and provided additional important insights into BVD epidemiology. Compared to other countries with intensive production systems, over the fence contact appeared to play a more important role in New Zealand pastoral-based production systems and should be considered when developing strategies for a national BVD control programme."

The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences were compared phylogenetically with those of known human and animal enteric caliciviruses. Based on these analyses, 15 BECVs belonged to Norovirus genogroup III and genotype 2 (GIII/2) and were genetically distinct from human Norovirus GI and GII. Six BECVs had capsid gene sequences similar to that of the unclassified Nebraska (NB)-like BECV. The 15 bovine noroviruses (BoNVs) were more closely related to Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK (GIII/2) and other known genotype 2 BoNVs than to genotype 1 Bo/NLV/Jena/80/DE. The BoNV Bo/CV521-OH/02/US showed high nucleotide and amino acid identities (84 and 94%, respectively) with the capsid gene of Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK, whereas the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the RNA polymerase gene were more closely related to those of Bo/NLV/Jena/80/DE (77 and 87% identities, respectively) than to those of Bo/NLV/Newbury-2/76/UK (69 and 69% identities, respectively), suggesting that Bo/CV521-OH/02/US is a genotype 1-2 recombinant. Gene conversion analysis by the recombinant identification program and SimPlot also predicted that Bo/CV521-OH/02/US was a recombinant. Six NB-like BECVs shared 88 to 92% nucleotide and 94 to 99.5% amino acid identities with the NB BECV in the capsid gene. The results of this study demonstrate genetic diversity in the capsid genes of BECVs circulating in Ohio veal calves, provide new data for coinfections with distinct BECV genotypes or genogroups, and describe the first natural BoNV genotype 1-2 recombinant, analogous to the previously reported human norovirus recombinants."

In the late summers of 2006 and 2012, severe outbreaks of pneumonia with mortality rates of 25-30% occurred. During the 2012 epidemic high quality samples from culled sick animals were obtained for microbiological and pathological examinations. High throughput sequencing (pyrosequencing) of pneumonic lung tissue revealed high concentrations of Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae in all six animals examined by this method and Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida in four animals, whereas no virus sequences could be identified. Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae and P. multocida multocida were also isolated by culture. Using real time PCR on lung swabs, M. ovipneumoniae was detected in all of the 19 pneumonic lungs examined. Gross pathological examination revealed heavy consolidations primarily in the cranial parts of the lungs and it also identified one case of otitis media. Histologically, lung lesions were characterized as acute to subacute mixed exudative and moderately proliferative bronchoalveolar pneumonia. Immunohistochemical (IHC) examination revealed high load of M. ovipneumoniae antigens within lung lesions, with particularly intensive staining in the neutrophils. Similar IHC finding were observed in archived lung tissue blocks from animals examined during the 2006 epidemic. An M. ovipneumoniae specific ELISA was applied on bio-banked muskox sera from stray muskoxen killed in the period 2004-2013 and sick muskoxen culled, as well as sera from wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) on Dovre and muskoxen from Greenland. Serology and mycoplasma culturing was also carried out on sheep that had been on pasture in the muskox area during the outbreak in 2012. Our findings indicated separate introductions of M. ovipneumoniae infection in 2006 and 2012 from infected co-grazing sheep. Salt licks shared by the two species were a possible route of transmitting infection."

Such methods are often PCR-based and hence require the availability of sequence data from the pathogen. Rattus norvegicus (R. norvegicus) is a known reservoir for important zoonotic pathogens. Transmission may be direct via contact with the animal, for example, through exposure to its faecal matter, or indirectly mediated by arthropod vectors. Here we investigated the viral content in rat faecal matter (n=29) collected from two continents by analyzing 2.2 billion next-generation sequencing reads derived from both DNA and RNA. Among other virus families, we found sequences from members of the Picornaviridae to be abundant in the microbiome of all the samples. Here we describe the diversity of the picornavirus-like contigs including near-full-length genomes closely related to the Boone cardiovirus and Theiler's encephalomyelitis virus. From this study, we conclude that picornaviruses within R. norvegicus are more diverse than previously recognized. The virome of R. norvegicus should be investigated further to assess the full potential for zoonotic virus transmission."

SaV is a causative agent of gastroenteritis in children and adults. SaV can be divided into five genogroups (GI-GV), among which GI, GII, GIV and GV are known to infect humans, whereas SaV GIII infects porcine species. Detection methods include ELISA, RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR. Since few SaV studies have been conducted, it is difficult to draw correlations between or conclusions about rates of incidence, detection and overall prevalence. Nevertheless, most studies agree that SaV infection is more frequent in young children than adults and that infection in children almost always occurs by 5 years of age. In addition, children at day-care centres and institutions are at greatest risk of SaV-associated infection and transmission. Recently, a number of important findings concerning human SaV were discovered. SaV strains were detected in water samples, which included untreated wastewater specimens, treated wastewater samples and river samples. SaV strains were also detected in shellfish samples destined for human consumption, and recombinant SaV strains were identified in a number of different countries. The purpose of this review was to highlight the current knowledge of human SaV, which appears to be an increasingly important virus causing gastroenteritis in humans."

Phylogenetic analysis of the protease gene has revealed EDS virus to be genetically more closely related to bovine adenovirus type 7 (BAV-7) and ovine adenovirus isolate 287 (OAV287) than either of these two viruses are to other members of the genus Mastadenovirus or EDS virus is to an other member of the Aviadenovirus genus. The three viruses share further similarities in that they have a high percentage AT content in their genome and are characterized by having more compact genomes than other adenoviruses. The protease gene from all three viruses contained the active site residues (H55-D72-C122 triad) and C104 (providing a disulfide bond to cofactor pVIc). However, P137, found in all other members of the Mastadenovirus genus, and thought to be involved in trafficking, was missing from the protease of the EDS virus, BAV-7, and OAV287. These results suggest that EDS virus should be classified along with BAV-7 and OAV287 in a separate taxon."

The DlEPV is introduced into the tephritid fruit fly larval host along with the wasp egg at oviposition. We sequenced a shotgun genomic library of the DlEPV DNA and analyzed and compared the predicted protein sequences of eight ORFs with those of selected poxviruses and other organisms. BlastP searches showed that five of these are homologous to poxvirus putative proteins such as metalloprotease, a putative membrane protein, late transcription factor-3, virion surface protein, and poly (A) polymerase (PAP) regulatory small subunit. Three of these are similar to those of other organisms such as the gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) of Arabidopsis thaliana, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) of Caenorhabditis briggsae and lambda phage integrase (lambda-Int) of Enterococcus faecium. Transcription motifs for early (TGA,A/T,XXXXA) or late (TAAATG, TAAT, or TAAAT) gene expression conserved in poxviruses were identified with those ORFs. Phylogenetic analysis of multiple alignments of five ORFs and 20 poxvirus homologous sequences and of a concatenate of multiple alignments suggested that DlEPV probably diverged from the ancestral node between the fowlpox virus and the genus B, lepidopteran and orthopteran EPVs, to which Amsacta moorei and Melanoplus sanguinipes EPV, respectively, belong. The DlEPV putative GGT, eIF4A, and lambda-Int contained many conserved domains that typified these proteins. These homologues may be involved in either viral pathogenicity or enhancing parasitism via the gamma-glutamyl cycle and compensation of eIF4A levels in the parasitized fly, or via the integration of a portion of the viral genome into the wasp and/or parasitized fly."

In other geographical areas, the transmission of this virus is poorly understood. We used large sequence datasets (of the gene encoding the viral protein 1, VP1) and a Bayesian phylogenetic approach to compare the molecular epidemiology and geographical spread patterns of EV-71 subgenogroups B4, B5, C1, C2, and C4 in Europe relative to other parts of the world. For the study, European countries considered were European Union (EU) Member States and Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. Viruses of the B4, B5, and C4 subgenogroups circulate mainly in eastern and south-east Asia. In Europe sporadic introductions of these subgenogroups are observed, however C1 and C2 viruses predominate. The phylogenies showed evidence of multiple events of spread involving C1 and C2 viruses within Europe since the mid-1990s. Two waves of sporadic C2 infections also occurred in 2010 and 2013. The 2007 Dutch outbreak caused by C2 and the occurrence of B5 and C4 infections in the EU between 2004 and 2013 arose while the circulation of C1 viruses was low. A transmission chain involving a C4 virus was traced from Japan to the EU and then further to Canada between 2001 and 2006. Recent events whereby spread of viruses have occurred from, to, and within Europe appear to be involved in the long term survival of EV-71, highlighting the need for enhanced surveillance of this virus."

ALV is highly pathogenic and induces a wide spectrum of disease in infected animals. ALV can be divided into five subgroups (A-E). The envelope glycoprotein (env gp85) is the main antigen determinant and responsible for subgroup classification. Viral RNA of all subgroups (A-E) was isolated and amplified using three sets of primers. Subsequently, restriction endonuclease analysis confirmed the product identity and discriminated between subgroups. In specific pathogen free (SPF) eggs experimentally inoculated with ALV, viral RNA was found in allantoic fluids, as well as in vaccines spiked with different subgroups of ALV. No adventitious virus was detected in commercially available preparations. This system provides a rapid and specific in vitro method for the detection of ALV RNA as an extraneous agent and may be applied for quality control of avian vaccines."

In the U.S., only bovine rhinitis A virus 1 (BRAV1) has been identified while bovine rhinitis A virus 2 (BRAV2) and bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) were previously only identified in England and Japan, respectively. Metagenomic sequencing of a nasal swab from a bovine respiratory disease (BRD) diagnostic submission from Kansas identified contigs with approximately 90% nucleotide similarity to BRAV2 and BRBV. A combination of de novo and templated assemblies using reference genomes yielded near complete BRAV2 and BRBV genomes. The near complete genome of bovine rhinitis A virus 1 (BRAV1) was also determined from a historical isolate to enable further molecular epidemiological studies. A 5'-nuclease reverse transcription PCR assay targeting the 3D polymerase gene was designed and used to screen 204 archived BRD clinical specimens. Thirteen (6.4%) were positive. Metagenomic sequencing of six positive samples identified mixed BRAV1/BRAV2, BRAV1/BRBV and BRAV2/BRBV infections for five samples. One sample showed infection only with BRAV1. Seroprevalence studies using a cell culture adapted BRBV found immunofluorescence assay-reactive antibodies were common in the herds analyzed. Altogether, these results demonstrate that BRV infections are common in cattle with respiratory disease and that BRAV1, BRAV2 and BRBV co-circulate in U.S. cattle and have high similarity to viruses isolated more than 30 years ago from diverse locations."

Deep RNA sequencing of C/OK virus found a matrix 1 (M1) protein expression strategy that differed from that of ICV. The novelty of C/OK virus prompted us to investigate whether C/OK virus could exist in a nonswine species. Significantly, we found that C/OK virus was widespread in U.S. bovine herds, as demonstrated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and serological assays. Genome sequencing of three bovine viruses isolated from two herds in different states further confirmed these findings. To determine whether swine/bovine C/OK viruses can undergo reassortment with human ICV, and to clarify the taxonomic status of C/OK, in vitro reassortment and serological typing by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) were conducted. In vitro reassortment using two human ICV and two swine and bovine C/OK viruses demonstrated that human ICV and C/OK viruses were unable to reassort and produce viable progeny. Antigenically, no cross-recognition of detergent split virions was observed in AGID between human and nonhuman viruses by using polyclonal antibodies that were reactive to cognate antigens. Taken together, these results demonstrate that C/OK virus is genetically and antigenically distinct from ICV. The classification of the new virus in a separate genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family is proposed. The finding of C/OK virus in swine and bovine indicates that this new virus may spread and establish infection in other mammals, including humans. IMPORTANCE Influenza C viruses (ICV) are common human pathogens, infecting most people during childhood and adolescence, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms. While ICV have been isolated from both pigs and dogs, humans are thought to be the natural viral reservoir. Previously, we characterized an ICV-like virus isolated from pigs exhibiting symptoms of influenza virus-like illness. Here, we show molecular and serological data demonstrating widespread circulation of similar viruses in bovines. Deep RNA sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, and in vitro reassortment experiments demonstrate that animal ICV-like viruses are genetically distinct from human ICV. Antigenically, we show that ICV-like viruses are not recognized by ICV antibodies. En masse, these results suggest that bovine influenza virus warrants classification as a new genus of influenza virus. The finding of this novel virus that can infect multiple mammalian species warrants further research into its role in human health."

Here, we present the first genomic sequence of a reference strain of PCPV (VR634) along with the genomic sequence of a PPV (F00.120R) isolated in Finland from reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus). The F00.120R and VR634 genomes are 135 and 145 kb in length and contain 131 and 134 putative genes, respectively, with their genome organization being similar to that of other PPVs. The predicted proteins of F00.120R and VR634 have an average amino acid sequence identity of over 95%, whereas they share only 88 and 73% amino acid identity with the ORFV and BPSV proteomes, respectively. The most notable differences were found near the genome termini. F00.120R lacks six and VR634 lacks three genes seen near the right terminus of other PPVs. Four genes at the left end of F00.120R and one in the middle of both genomes appear to be fragmented paralogues of other genes within the genome. VR634 has larger than expected inverted terminal repeats possibly as a result of genomic rearrangements. The high G+C content (64%) of these two viruses along with amino acid sequence comparisons and whole genome phylogenetic analyses confirm the classification of PCPV as a separate species within the genus Parapoxvirus and verify that the virus responsible for an outbreak of contagious stomatitis in reindeer over the winter of 1999-2000 can be classified as PCPV."

Currently, a few sequences of viral protein (VP)1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 and nonstructural protein (NSP)1, 2, and 5 of bovine RVB are available in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases, and none have been reported for VP3, NSP3, and NSP4. In order to fill this gap in the genetic characterization of bovine RVB strains, we used a metagenomics approach and sequenced and analyzed the complete coding sequences (CDS) of VP3, NSP3, and NSP4 genes, as well as the partial or complete CDS of other genes of RVBs detected from Japanese cattle. VP3, NSP3, and NSP4 of bovine RVBs shared low nucleotide sequence identities (63.3-64.9% for VP3, 65.9-68.2% for NSP3, and 52.6-56.2% for NSP4) with those of murine, human, and porcine RVBs, suggesting that bovine RVBs belong to a novel genotype. Furthermore, significantly low amino acid sequence identities were observed for NSP4 (36.1-39.3%) between bovine RVBs and the RVBs of other species. In contrast, hydrophobic plot analysis of NSP4 revealed profiles similar to those of RVBs of other species and rotavirus A (RVA) strains. Phylogenetic analyses of all gene segments revealed that bovine RVB strains formed a cluster that branched distantly from other RVBs. These results suggest that bovine RVBs have evolved independently from other RVBs but in a similar manner to other rotaviruses.

We hypothesized that peptides representative of the diversity of natural HIV-1 V3 loop variants might capture elements of conserved higher order structures and so stimulate broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies. We designed a panel of 29 subtype B V3 sequences postulated to reflect the range of V3 diversity. These peptides were used to immunize guinea pigs. The most effective peptide (62.19) clustered around the subtype B consensus sequence and induced antibodies that reproducibly neutralized 31% of the subtype B HIV-1 primary isolates evaluated, but exhibited limited cross-neutralization of non-subtype B HIV-1 strains. Taken together, these data demonstrated that the limited neutralization profile of antibodies induced by optimal subtype B V3 motifs likely represents the maximum breadth of neutralization of subtype B HIV-1 primary isolates attainable by anti-V3 peptide antibodies."

          <jats:p>Bats are natural reservoirs for many pathogenic viruses, and increasing evidence supports the notion that bats can also harbor group A rotaviruses (RVAs), important causative agents of diarrhea in children and young animals. Currently, 8 RVA strains possessing completely novel genotype constellations or genotypes possibly originating from other mammals have been identified from African and Chinese bats. However, all the data were mainly based on detection of RVA RNA, present only during acute infections, which does not permit assessment of the true exposure of a bat population to RVA. To systematically investigate the genetic diversity of RVAs, 547 bat anal swabs or gut samples along with 448 bat sera were collected from five South Chinese provinces. Specific reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) screening found four RVA strains. Strain GLRL1 possessed a completely novel genotype constellation, whereas the other three possessed a constellation consistent with the MSLH14-like genotype, a newly characterized group of viruses widely prevalent in Chinese insectivorous bats. Among the latter, strain LZHP2 provided strong evidence of cross-species transmission of RVAs from bats to humans, whereas strains YSSK5 and BSTM70 were likely reassortants between typical MSLH14-like RVAs and human RVAs. RVA-specific antibodies were detected in 10.7% (48/448) of bat sera by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA). Bats in Guangxi and Yunnan had a higher RVA-specific antibody prevalence than those from Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. These observations provide evidence for cross-species transmission of MSLH14-like bat RVAs to humans, highlighting the impact of bats as reservoirs of RVAs on public health.</jats:p>

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Bat viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola, Hendra, and Nipah viruses, are important pathogens causing outbreaks of severe emerging infectious diseases. However, little is known about bat viruses capable of causing gastroenteritis in humans, even though 8 group A viruses (RVAs) have been identified from bats so far. In this study, another 4 RVA strains were identified, with one providing strong evidence for zoonotic transmission from bats to humans. Serological investigation has also indicated that RVA infection in bats is far more prevalent than expected based on the detection of viral RNA.

An approach based on viral metagenomics was used to study gut specimens from 78 insectivorous bats in Yunnan Province, China. Seventy-four reads were found to be related to group A rotavirus (RVA). Further reverse transcription-PCR screening and viral isolation on cell cultures confirmed the presence of a novel RVA strain, named RVA/Bat-tc/MSLH14/2012/G3P[3], in 1 (6%) of 16 lesser horseshoe bats. Full genomic sequencing analyses showed that MSLH14 possessed the genotype constellation G3-P[3]-I8-R3-C3-M3-A9-N3-T3-E3-H6, which is akin to human and animal rotaviruses believed to be of feline/canine origin. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that VP7 was most closely related to bovine RVA strains from India, whereas VP4 was most closely related to an unusual human RVA strain, CMH222, with animal characteristics isolated in Thailand. The remaining gene segments were only distantly related to a range of animal RVA strains, most of which are believed to be related to feline/canine RVAs. Experimental infection showed that bat RVA strain MSLH14 was highly pathogenic to suckling mice, causing 100% mortality when they were inoculated orally with a titer as low as 5 Ã 10Â² 50% tissue culture infective doses. As this virus is not closely related to any known RVA strain, it is tempting to speculate that it is a true bat RVA strain rather than a virus transmitted between species. However, further screening of bat populations, preferably juvenile animals, will be crucial in determining whether or not this virus is widely distributed in the bat population."

MSB-1 derived from chicken Marek's disease (MD) lymphomas is an MDV-transformed CD4+ T-cell line for MD study. Previously, DNase I HS sites were studied mainly in human cell types for mammalian. To capture the regulatory elements specific to MSB1 cells and explore the molecular mechanisms of T-cell transformation caused by MDV in MD, we generated high-quality of DHSs map and gene expression profile for functional analysis in MSB1 cell line. The total of 21,724 significant peaks of DHSs was identified from around 40 million short reads. DHSs distribution varied between chromosomes and they preferred to enrich in the gene-rich chromosomes. More interesting, DHSs enrichments appeared to be scarce on regions abundant in CpG islands. Besides, we integrated DHSs into the gene expression data and found that DHSs tended to enrich on high expressed genes throughout whole gene regions while DHSs did not show significant changes for low and silent expressed genes. Furthermore, the correlation of DHSs with lincRNAs expression was also calculated and it implied that enhancer-associated lincRNAs probably originated from enhancer-like regions of DHSs. Together, our results indicated that DNase I HS sites highly correlate with active genes expression in MSB1 cells, suggesting DHSs can be considered as markers to identify the cis-regulatory elements associated with chicken Marek's disease."

A pigeon-adapted variant of genotype VI NDV, often termed pigeon paramyxovirus 1, is commonly isolated from columbids in the United States and worldwide. Complete genomic characterization of these genotype VI viruses circulating in wild columbids in the United States is limited, and due to the genetic variability of the virus, failure of rapid diagnostic detection has been reported. Therefore, in this study, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify and characterize these circulating viruses, providing valuable genetic information. NGS enables multiple samples to be deep-sequenced in parallel. When used on FFPE samples, this methodology allows for retrospective studies of infectious organisms. FFPE wild pigeon tissue samples (kidney, liver and spleen) from 10 mortality events in the U.S. between 2010 and 2016 were analyzed using NGS to detect and sequence NDV genomes from randomly amplified total RNA. Results were compared to the previously published immunohistochemistry (IHC) results conducted on the same samples. Additionally, phylogenetic analyses were conducted on the complete and partial fusion gene and complete genome coding sequences. Twenty-three out of 29 IHC-positive FFPE pigeon samples were identified as positive for NDV by NGS. Positive samples produced an average genome coverage of 99.6% and an average median depth of 199. A previously described sub-genotype (VIa) and a novel sub-genotype (VIn) of NDV were identified as the causative agent of 10 pigeon mortality events in the U.S. from 2010 to 2016. The distribution of these viruses from the North American lineages match the distribution of the Eurasian collared-doves and rock pigeons in the U.S. This work reports the first successful evolutionary study using deep sequencing of complete NDV genomes from FFPE samples of wild bird origin. There are at least two distinct U.S. lineages of genotype VI NDV maintained in wild pigeons that are continuously evolving independently from each other and have no evident epidemiological connections to viruses circulating abroad. These findings support the hypothesis that columbids are serving as reservoirs of virulent NDV in the U.S."

Monitoring viral evolution and spread is crucial for surveillance and tracing programmes, which are currently based on serological or DNA sequencing-phylogenetics analysis. However, virus-host interactions, antigenic drift and spreading of viral clades strongly depend on variation in the surface features of capsid proteins. We report here that in silico comparative structural analysis of haemagglutinin can reveal relevant evolutionary fingerprints, particularly when integrated with sequence-based analyses. Phylogenetic analyses of H9 viral strains from wild birds and poultry, performed with different methods, reliably led to clustering of viruses into five main groups. Subsequent comparison of structural features showed congruence between such clustering and surface electrostatic fingerprints. These latter fingerprints relate group-specific variations in electrostatic charges and isocontours to well-known haemagglutinin sites involved in the modulation of immune escape and host specificity. This work suggests that the integration of structural and sequence comparisons may enhance investigations of trends and relevant mechanisms in viral evolution."

An artificial neural network (ANN) automates the interpretation of subtle differences in fluorescence intensity patterns from the microarray. The complete process from clinical specimen to identification including amplification of viral RNA can be completed in <8 hours for under US$10. The work presented here represents an effort to expand and test the capabilities of the MChip to differentiate influenza A/H1N1 of various species origin. The MChip ANN was trained to recognize fluorescence image patterns of a variety of known influenza A viruses, including examples of human H1N1, human H3N2, swine H1N1, 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1, and a wide variety of avian, equine, canine, and swine influenza viruses. Robustness of the MChip ANN was evaluated using 296 blinded isolates. Training of the ANN was expanded by the addition of 71 well-characterized influenza A isolates and yielded relatively high accuracy (little misclassification) in distinguishing unique H1N1 strains: nine human A/H1N1 (88Â·9% correct), 35 human A/H3N2 (97Â·1% correct), 31 North American swine A/H1N1 (80Â·6% correct), 14 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 (87Â·7% correct), and 23 negative samples (91Â·3% correct). Genetic diversity among the swine H1N1 isolates may have contributed to the lower success rate for these viruses. The current study demonstrates the MChip has the capability to differentiate the genetic variations among influenza viruses with appropriate ANN training. Further selective enrichment of the ANN will improve its ability to rapidly and reliably characterize influenza viruses of unknown origin."

The full length of the known variable protein ÏC and part of the ÏB encoding genes, were amplified with RT-PCR, using conserved primers. PCR products were sequenced and the sequences were analyzed and aligned with avian reovirus sequences from the Genbank database. The sequences of ÏC-encoding genes of all the isolated strains indicated their close relationship with the American, Chinese and Indian strains. Taking the American strain S1133 as a reference, the two Tunisian isolates 97.1 and 97.2 showed some nucleotide substitutions. For isolate 97.1, the substitution was silent whereas for strain 97.2 the mutation was at the first position of the corresponding codon and induced the substitution of the amino acid encoded. For the ÏB-encoding gene, the sequences of the Tunisian strains showed mutations at positions two or three of the corresponding codons, inducing substitutions of amino acids at these positions. The phylogenic trees based on ÏC and ÏB encoding genes indicated closer relationship between Tunisian, American and Taiwanese isolates of genotype I. Our study describes the genotype of avian reoviruses that are not yet well characterized genetically. The characterization and classification of these viruses might be significant for understanding the epidemiology of malabsorption syndrome and viral arthritis, and improving our knowledge of the genotype of strains circulating in Tunisian flocks. Furthermore, the study of their variable pathogenicity could be extremely important in the choice of the appropriate vaccine strain to control disease."

Previous studies with this serotype have indicated that the viruses circulating in India belong to a single genotype. Recent (February 2001) FMD epidemics in Europe have focussed global attention on the source of the virus and have been traced to a strain, PanAsia (serotype O), which is present in India since 1990. In this study, to further characterize the isolates belonging to the PanAsian strain, we sequenced the complete VP1-encoding (1 D) gene for 71 FMDV serotype O isolates from India recovered from the field outbreaks during the last 4 decades (1962-2001). All the isolates in the tree were distributed in to three major branches (designated as A, B and C); the branch C is further divided into four groups (I-IV), of which the group IV belongs to the PanAsia strain. Furthermore, we show that the PanAsia strain has been circulating endemically since 1982 (not 1990 as reported earlier) and has been the most dominant outbreak strain in the recent years and distributed at least in 17 states of the country. During the year 2001, another new group (group III) of virus with genetic divergence of 5.4-11.1% at nucleotide level from the PanAsia strain is found to co-circulate endemically, and is slowly replacing it. At amino acid level this strain differed from PanAsia strain at five amino acid positions in the VP1. Although these strains are divergent at nucleotide level, they maintained a good antigenic relationship with one of the vaccine strains (IND R2/75) widely used in the country. Given the ability of the PanAsia virus to persist, spread and to outcompete other strains, the present trend could be of serious concern as the newly emerging virus is replacing it. If this is true, then there is another equally divergent strain as PanAsia that may pose a serious threat to the global dairy and meat industries."

The sequences were compared with each other and reference viruses. The published sequences of 15 type O isolates recovered from different parts of Asia and one isolate (O1BFS) from Europe and one from Egypt (O1/Sharquia/Egypt/72) were also included in the analysis for comparison. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis the viruses could be grouped into four distinct genotypes (genotypes I-IV). All 90 isolates from India were genotype-I, as were the reference isolates from Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey. Genotype-I isolates were further subdivided into 16 sub-genotypes. The Indian isolates were found to be extremely heterogeneous in nature and clustered into 12 different genetic groups. In genotype-I, the nucleotide sequence difference seen between the isolates was 0-11.6%, while among the Indian isolates it is 0-8.8%. Viruses of similar genetic groups are circulating in India, Bangladesh and countries of the Middle East. Genotype-II and -III are represented by isolates from Lebanon (O1/South Lebanon) and Europe (O1-BFS), respectively. Genotype-IV is formed by isolates from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The present study reveals the occurrence of viruses belonging to multiple genetic groups over a short period of time and persistence of single genetic group in the same geographical area over several years. This is consistent with the endemic nature of the disease in the country."

That is, the Thai strains are more closely related to each other than they are to strains from the USA or Indonesia, despite the variety of symptoms caused by these strains and the overlap of symptom types between the strains from different locations. Like other PStV strains, PStV-Thai can be considered strains of bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) but can be distinguished from bean-infecting strains of BCMV and blackeye cowpea mosaic virus (B1CMV) through sequence and host range. No evidence was found that PStV-Thai strains, unlike PStV-Ib, are recombinants of PStV and B1CMV, although the T3 strain may be a recombinant of different PStV sequences.

Our study supports amplification of IAV during summer breeding seeded by overwintering virus persisting locally and virus introduced from a wide range of latitudes. As birds migrate from breeding sites to lower latitudes, they become involved in transmission networks with greater connectivity to other bird species, with interspecies transmission of reassortant viruses peaking during the winter.

However, the real impact of TTV on liver diseases remains uncertain to date. Due to the lack of suitable cell systems to support the growth of TTV, the biology of TTV is still obscure. This review tries to summarise the current status of TTV on aspects other than the taxonomic diversity of TTV. TTV was the first human virus with a single stranded circular DNA genome. TTV was considered to be a member of Circoviridae, but others suggested it conformed to a new family. TTV is distinct from ambisense viruses in the genus Circovirus, since the former genome is negative stranded. The genome structure of TTV is more related to chicken anaemia virus in the genus Gyrovirus, however, the sequence similarity is minimal except for a short stretch at 3816-3851 of TA278. Currently the working group is proposing the full name for TTV as TorqueTenoVirus and the TTV-like mini virus as TorqueTenoMiniVirus (TTMV) in a new genus Anellovirus (ring). TTVs are prevalent in non-human primates and human TTV can cross-infect chimpanzees. Furthermore, TTV sequences have been detected in chickens, pigs, cows and sheep. TTV can be transmitted by mother-to-child infection. However, within a year after birth, the prevalence reaches the same level for children born to both TTV-positive and TTV-negative mothers even without breast-feeding. The non-coding region surrounding a short 113 nt GC-rich stretch and occupying approximately one-third of the genome is considered to contain the putative replication origin. Three mRNAs are expressed by TTV, 3.0 and 1.2 and 1.0 kb species. A protein translated from the 3.0 kb mRNA is considered to be the major capsid protein as well as replicase. The nature of the proteins translated by the other two mRNAs are still putative."

TTV has a single stranded circular DNA of approximately 3.8 kb. TTVs are extraordinarily diverse, spanning five groups including SANBAN and SEN viruses. Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) with approximately 2.9 kb genome also has wide variants. Recently, two related 2.2- and 2.6-kb species joined this community. Recombinations between variants are frequent. This extensive TTV diversity remains unexplained; it is unclear how TTVs could be viable, and why they require such genetic variation. An unequivocal culture system is still not available. TTVs are ubiquitous in > 90% of adults worldwide but no human pathogenicity of TTV has been fully established. Epidemiological surveys need to specify the variants being studied and clinical targets, and must calibrate the sensitivity of the assay used. Potentially interesting observations include a higher viral load in patients with severe idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, cancer and lupus. Active replication was also found in infants with acute respiratory diseases. TTV/TTMV-related viruses were found in chimpanzees, apes, African monkeys and tupaias, and also in chickens, pigs, cows, sheep and dogs. Experimentally, rhesus monkeys were persistently infected by TTV, but only 1/53 chimpanzees. TTV transcribes three species of mRNAs, 3.0-, 1.2- and 1.0-kb in the ratio of 60:5:35. Recently, at least three mRNAs were shown in chicken anaemia virus. The genomic region -154/-76 contains a critical promoter. TTV seems to have at least three proteins; however, the definite functions of these proteins await further research work."

Each has a circular single-stranded (ss)DNA genome with every one of its known open reading frames (ORF) on its antigenomic strand. This structure is distinct from those of circoviruses. The genomic sizes of TTV and CAV are different, 3.8 kb and 2.3 kb, respectively. While the spectrum of the TTV genome is enormously diverse, that of the CAV genome is quite narrow. Although a 36-nt stretch near the replication origin of TA278 TTV possesses more than 80% similarity to that of CAV, the sequence of the other genomic regions does not exhibit a significant similarity. Nevertheless, the relative allocation of ORFs on each frame in these viruses mimics each other. Three or more messenger RNA (mRNAs) are generated by transcription in both of them. The structural protein with the replicase domain is coded for by frame 1 in each virus, and a nonstructural protein with a phosphatase domain is coded for by frame 2. A protein on frame 3 in each virus induces apoptosis in transformed cells. Recently, we confirmed that apoptin is necessary for the replication of CAV. TTV has been proposed to constitute a new family, Anelloviridae. Considering these similarities and dissimilarities between CAV and TTV, it seems more reasonable to place CAV, the only member of genus Gyrovirus, into Anelloviridae together with TTV, or into a new independent family."

It possesses two distinct catalytic activities: (i) C-terminal processing at the L/VP4 junction; and (ii) induction of the cleavage of translation initiation factor eIF4G, an event that inhibits cap-dependent translation in infected cells. The only other member of the <jats:italic>Aphthovirus</jats:italic> genus, equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV), also encodes an L protein, but this shares only 32% amino acid identity with its FMDV counterpart. Another more distantly related picornavirus, equine rhinitis B virus (ERBV), which is not classified as an aphthovirus, also encodes an L protein. Using <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> transcription and translation analysis, we have shown that both ERAV and ERBV L proteins have C-terminal processing activity. Furthermore, expression of ERAV L, but not ERBV L, in BHK-21 cells resulted in the efficient inhibition of cap-dependent translation in these cells. We have shown that the ERAV and FMDV L proteinases induce cleavage of eIF4GI at very similar or identical positions. Interestingly, ERAV 3C also induces eIF4GI cleavage and again produces distinct products that co-migrate with those induced by FMDV 3C. The ERBV L proteinase does not induce eIF4GI cleavage, consistent with its inability to shut down cap-dependent translation. We have also shown that another unique feature of FMDV L, the stimulation of enterovirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activity, is also shared by the ERAV L proteinase but not by ERBV L. The functional conservation of the divergent ERAV and FMDV proteinases indicates the likelihood of a similar and important role for these enzymes in the pathogenesis of infections caused by these distantly related aphthoviruses.</jats:p>"

SIV from all four subspecies of African green monkeys (SIVagm) have been characterized with an apparent chimeric genome structure of SIVagm from West African green monkeys. Although these naturally infected primates remain healthy, cross-species transmission to other primate species may result in immunodeficiency, as caused by SIVsm infection of macaque monkeys (Macaca sp.) and recently, SIVagm infection of pig-tailed macaques (M. nemestrina). Studies of variation within infected individuals have been facilitated by adaptation of the techniques of heteroduplex analysis and single-stranded conformational polymorphism of PCR generated fragments."

Gross pathological lesions were absent or inconsistent in most of the cases, but severe and consistent microscopic lesions were found in the brain and spinal cord, characterized by non-purulent panencephalomyelitis. Several virus isolates were obtained in embryonated duck eggs and in cell cultures (Vero and DF-1) inoculated with the brain homogenates of affected ducks. After exclusion of other viruses, the isolates were identified as a flavivirus by flavivirus-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Inoculation of 2-week-old Pekin ducks with a flavivirus isolate by the subcutaneous or intramuscular route resulted in typical clinical signs and histological lesions in the brain and spinal cord. The inoculated virus was detected by RT-PCR from organ samples of ducks with clinical signs and histological lesions. With a few days delay, the disease was also observed among co-mingled contact control birds. Phylogenetic analysis of NS5 and E gene sequences proved that the isolates were representatives of a novel phylogenetic group within clade XI (Ntaya virus group) of the Flavivirus genus. This Malaysian Duck Tembusu Virus (DTMUV), named Perak virus, has moderate genomic RNA sequence similarity to a related DTMUV identified in China. In our experiment the Malaysian strain of DTMUV could be transmitted in the absence of mosquito vectors. These findings may have implications for the control and prevention of this emerging group of flaviviruses."

Before this report, no comparative genetic studies or molecular detection assays had been developed for this virus genus. To characterize at least one representative from each of the seven serogroups, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) primers targeting the L polymerase-encoding region of the RNA genome of these viruses were successfully designed based on conserved amino acid motifs present in the predicted catalytic core region. Sequence analysis showed the nairoviruses to be a highly diverse group, exhibiting up to 39.4% and 46.0% nucleotide and amino acid identity differences, respectively. Virus genetic relationships correlated well with serologic groupings and with tick host associations. Hosts of these viruses include both the hard (family Ixodidae) and soft (family Argasidae) ticks. Virus phylogenetic analysis reveals two major monophyletic groups: hard tick and soft tick-vectored viruses. In addition, viruses vectored by Ornithodoros, Carios, and Argas genera ticks also form three separate monophyletic lineages. The striking similarities between tick and nairovirus phylogenies are consistent with possible coevolution of the viruses and their tick hosts. Fossil and phylogenetic data placing the hard tick-soft tick divergence between 120 and 92 million years ago suggest an ancient origin for viruses of the genus Nairovirus."

However, traditional microbiological culture-based methods are limited, particularly in their ability to provide timely data. The present review discusses the reasons for the increasing interest in rapid methods, current developments in the field, the research needs, and the future trends. The advent of biotechnology has introduced new technologies that led to the emergence of rapid diagnostic methods and altered food testing practices. Rapid methods are comprised of many different detection technologies, including specialized enzyme substrates, antibodies and DNA, ranging from simple differential plating media to the use of sophisticated instruments. The use of non-invasive sampling techniques for live animals especially came into focus with the 1990s outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy that was linked to the human outbreak of Creutzfeldt Jakob's Disease. Serology is still an important tool in preventing foodborne pathogens to enter the human food supply through meat and milk from animals. One of the primary uses of rapid methods is for fast screening of large number of samples, where most of them are expected to be test-negative, leading to faster product release for sale. This has been the main strength of rapid methods such as real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Enrichment PCR, where a primary culture broth is tested in PCR, is the most common approach in rapid testing. Recent reports show that it is possible both to enrich a sample and enumerate by pathogen-specific real-time PCR, if the enrichment time is short. This can be especially useful in situations where food producers ask for the level of pathogen in a contaminated product. Another key issue is automation, where the key drivers are miniaturization and multiple testing, which mean that not only one instrument is flexible enough to test for many pathogens but also many pathogens can be detected with one test. The review is mainly based on the author's scientific work that has contributed with the following new developments to this field: (i) serologic tests for large-scale screening, surveillance, or eradication programs, (ii) same-day detection of Salmonella that otherwise was considered as difficult to achieve, (iii) pathogen enumeration following a short log-phase enrichment, (iv) detection of foodborne pathogens in air samples, and finally (v) biotracing of pathogens based on mathematical modeling, even in the absence of isolate. Rapid methods are discussed in a broad global health perspective, international food supply, and for improvement of quantitative microbial risk assessments. The need for quantitative sample preparation techniques, culture-independent, metagenomic-based detection, online monitoring, a global validation infrastructure has been emphasized. The cost and ease of use of rapid assays remain challenging obstacles to surmount."

However, scrapie strains can be distinguished to some extent by biological properties such as transmissibility to experimental animals and distribution of neuropathological lesions and by biochemical properties such as the molecular mass and relative protease-resistance of the disease-specific isoform of prion protein (PrP(Sc)). In order to preliminarily characterize the scrapie strains that are prevalent in Japan, we analyzed the transmissibility of sheep scrapie isolates to mice and the relative proteinase K (PK) resistance of the corresponding PrP(Sc). The results indicate that Japanese scrapie strains can be divided into at least three groups based on biological and biochemical properties. The first group includes isolates which cause disease in mice with an incubation period of approximately 400 days and possess PrP(Sc) with relatively high PK resistance. Isolates of the second group contain PrP(Sc) that is highly resistant to PK digestion but transmit poorly to mice. The final group consists of isolates that cause disease in mice with an incubation period of less than 300 days and are associated with PrP(Sc) with reduced PK resistance. Sheep scrapie has occurred sporadically in Japan since1982, with only approximately 60 officially reported cases so far. However, the diversity of scrapie strains in the field suggested by our data raises the concern that a scrapie strain similar to the parental agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy could exist or emerge in Japan. Thus, continuous surveillance for scrapie will be required to prevent the further spread of scrapie, not only among the sheep population but also to other species, and to eliminate any potential risk of sheep scrapie to public health."

These are challenging in any circumstances, but particularly during conflict. Here we describe available human rabies surveillance data from Iraq, results of renewed sampling for rabies in animals, and the first genetic characterisation of circulating rabies strains from Iraq. Human rabies is notifiable, with reported cases increasing since 2003, and a marked increase in Baghdad between 2009 and 2010. These changes coincide with increasing numbers of reported dog bites. There is no laboratory confirmation of disease or virus characterisation and no systematic surveillance for rabies in animals. To address these issues, brain samples were collected from domestic animals in the greater Baghdad region and tested for rabies. Three of 40 brain samples were positive using the fluorescent antibody test and hemi-nested RT-PCR for rabies virus (RABV). Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using partial nucleoprotein gene sequences derived from the samples demonstrated the viruses belong to a single virus variant and share a common ancestor with viruses from neighbouring countries, 22 (95% HPD 14-32) years ago. These include countries lying to the west, north and east of Iraq, some of which also have other virus variants circulating concurrently. These results suggest possible multiple introductions of rabies into the Middle East, and regular trans-boundary movement of disease. Although 4000 years have passed since the original description of disease consistent with rabies, animals and humans are still dying of this preventable and neglected zoonosis."

These viruses replicate in a wide range of cell types including human cells in vitro and they can cause both hematological and neurological disorders in feral as well as in the inbred laboratory mice. Since MuLV-A's also exhibit discrete interference and neutralization properties, the envelope proteins of these viruses have been extremely useful for studying virus-host cell interactions and as vehicles for transfer of foreign genes into a variety of hosts including human cells. However, the genomic structure of any of the several known MuLV-A's has not been established and the evolutionary relationship of amphotropic retroviruses to the numerous exogenous or endogenous MuLV strains remains elusive. Herein we present a complete genetic structure of a novel amphotropic virus designated MuLV-1313 and demonstrate that this retrovirus together with other MuLV-A's belongs to a distinct molecular, biological and phylogenetic class among the MuLV strains isolated from a large number of the laboratory inbred or feral mice. The host range of MuLV-1313 is similar to the previously isolated MuLV-A's except that this virus replicates efficiently in mammalian as well as in chicken cells. Compared to ENV proteins of other MuLV-A's (4070A, 1504A and 10A-1), the gp70 protein of MuLV-1313 exhibits differences in its signal peptides and the proline-rich hinge regions. However, the MuLV-1313 envelope protein is totally unrelated to those present in a broad range of murine retroviruses that have been isolated from various inbred and feral mice globally. Genetic analysis of the entire MuLV-1313 genome by dot plot analyses, which compares each nucleotide of one genome with the corresponding nucleotide of another, revealed that the genome of this virus, with the exception of the env gene, is more closely related to the biologically distinct wild mouse ecotropic retrovirus (Cas-Br-E) isolated from another region of the Southern California, than to any of the 15 MuLV strains whose full-length sequences are present in the GenBank. This finding was corroborated by phylogenetic analyses and hierarchical clustering of the entire genomic sequence of MuLV-1313, which also placed all MULV-A's in a genetically distinct category among the large family of retroviruses isolated from numerous mouse strains globally. Likewise, construction of separate dendrograms for each of the Gag, Pol and Env proteins of MuLV-1313 demonstrated that the amphotropic retroviruses belong to a phylogenetically exclusive group of gammaretroviruses compared to all known MuLV strains. The molecular, biological and phylogenetic properties of amphotropic retroviruses including MuLV-1313 are distinct compared to a large family of exogenously- or endogenously-transmitted ecotropic, polytropic and xenotropic MuLV strains of the laboratory and feral mice. Further, both the naturally occurring amphotropic and a biologically discrete ecotropic retrovirus of the Southern California wild mice are more closely related to each other on the evolutionary tree than any other mammalian gammaretrovirus indicating a common origin of these viruses. This is the first report of a complete genomic analysis of a unique group of phylogenetically distinct amphotropic virus."

Each month cloacal and tracheal swabs were taken from 30 randomly selected birds that appeared healthy. All of the swabs were negative for influenza A virus recovery, whereas 87.5% of tracheal swabs and 100% cloacal swabs collected in September 2007, were positive for Newcastle disease virus isolation. Several NDV isolates were recovered from tracheal and cloacal swabs of apparently healthy ducks. All of the isolates were apathogenic as determined by the MDT and ICPI. The HN gene and the variable region of F gene (nt 47-420) of four isolates selected at random were sequenced. A 374 bp region of F gene and the full length of HN gene were used for phylogenetic analysis. Four isolates were identified as the same isolate based on nucleotide sequences identities of 99.2-100%, displaying a closer phylogenetic relationship to lentogenic Class I viruses. There were 1.9-9.9% nucleotide differences between the isolates and other Class I virus in the variable region of F gene (nt 47-420), whereas there were 38.5-41.2% nucleotide difference between the isolates and Class II viruses. The amino acid sequences of the F protein cleavage sites in these isolates were 112-ERQERL-117. The full length of HN gene of these isolates was 1851 bp, coding 585 amino acids. The homology analysis of the nucleotide sequence of HN gene indicated that there were 2.0-4.2% nucleotide differences between the isolates and other Class I viruses, whereas there were 29.5-40.9% differences between the isolates and Class II viruses. The results shows that these isolates are not phylogenetically related to the vaccine strain (LaSota). This study adds to the understanding of the ecology of influenza viruses and Newcastle disease viruses in ducks and emphasizes the need for constant surveillance in times of an ongoing and expanding epidemic of AIV and NDV."

C-strain vaccination is one of the most effective ways to contain this disease. Since 2014, sporadic CSF outbreaks have been occurring in some C-strain vaccinated provinces of China. To decipher the disease etiology, 25 CSFV E2 genes from 169 clinical samples were cloned and sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all 25 isolates belonged to subgenotype 2.1. Twenty-three of the 25 isolates were clustered in a newly defined subgenotype, 2.1d, and shared some consistent molecular characteristics. To determine whether the complete E2 gene was under positive selection pressure, we used a site-by-site analysis to identify specific codons that underwent evolutionary selection, and seven positively selected codons were found. Three positively selected sites (amino acids 17, 34, and 72) were identified in antigenicity-relevant domains B/C of the amino-terminal half of the E2 protein. In addition, another positively selected site (amino acid 200) exhibited a polarity change from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, which may change the antigenicity and virulence of CSFV.

Moreover, the identification of these positively selected sites could help to reveal molecular determinants of virulence or pathogenesis, and to clarify the driving force of CSFV evolution in East China."

To analyze pathogenic species in bats from southeast coastal regions of China, we performed metagenomic sequencing technology for high throughput sequencing of six sentinels from southeast coastal area of China. We obtained 5,990,261 high quality reads from intestine and lung tissue of 235 bats, including 2,975,371 assembled sequences. 631,490 reads predicted overlapping sequences for the open reading frame (ORF), which accounts for 2.37% of all the sequences (15,012/631,490). Further, the acquired virus sequences were classified into 25 viral families, including 16 vertebrate viruses, four plant viruses and five insect viruses. All bat samples were screened by specific PCR and phylogenetic analysis. Using these techniques, we discovered many novel bat viruses and some bat viruses closely-related to known human/animal pathogens, including coronavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, astrovirus, and circovirus. In summary, this study extended our understanding of bats as the viral reservoirs. Additionally, it also provides a basis for furher studying the transmission of viruses from bats to humans.</jats:p>"

The HA protein facilitates the viral binding and entering a host cell and the NA protein helps the release of viral progeny from the infected cell. The complementary roles of HA and NA entail their collaboration, which has important implications for viral replication and fitness. The HA protein from early strains of pandemic 2009 H1N1 of swine origin preferentially binds to human type receptors with a weak binding to avian type receptors. This virus caused several human deaths in December 2013 in Texas, USA, which motivated us to investigate the changes of genetic features that might contribute to the surged virulence of the virus. Our time series analysis on the strains of this virus collected from 2009 to 2013 implied that the HA binding preference of this virus in USA, Europe, and Asia has been the characteristic of swine H1N1 virus since 2009. However, its characteristic of seasonal human H1N1 and its binding avidity for avian type receptors both were on steady rise and had a clear increase in 2013 with American strains having the sharpest surge. The first change could enhance the viral transmission and replication in humans and the second could increase its ability to cause infection deep in lungs, which might account for the recent human deaths in Texas. In light of HA and NA coadaptation and evolutionary interactions, we also explored the NA activity of this virus to reveal the functional balance between HA and NA during the course of virus evolution. Finally we identified amino acid substitutions in HA and NA of the virus that were critical for the observed evolution."

Although these viruses exhibit genetic homology, the clinical manifestations caused by the two viruses have some discrepancies. In addition, the underlying mechanisms leading to these differences remain unclear. microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in numerous biological or pathological processes, including host responses to viral infections. Here, we focused on differences in miRNA expression patterns in rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with EV71 and CA16 at various time points using high-throughput sequencing. The results demonstrated that 106 known and 13 novel miRNAs exhibited significant differences, and 32 key miRNAs among them for target prediction presented opposite trends in the EV71- and CA16-infected samples. GO and pathway analysis of the predicted targets showed enrichment in 14 biological processes, 10 molecular functions, 8 cellular components and 104 pathways. Subsequently, regulatory networks of miRNA-transcription factors, miRNA-predicted targets, miRNA-GOs and miRNA-pathways were constructed to reveal the complex regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during the infection phase. Ultimately, we analysed hierarchical GO categories of the predicted targets involved in immune system processes, which indicated that the innate and adaptive immunity following EV71 and CA16 infections may be remarkably distinct. In conclusion, this report is the first describing miRNA expression profiles in PBMCs with EV71 and CA16 infections using high-throughput sequencing. Our findings could provide a valuable basis for further studies on the regulatory roles of miRNAs related to the different immune responses caused by EV71 and CA16 infections."

Nevertheless, the factors underlying these differences remain unclear. Recently, the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) in pathogen-host interactions have been highlighted. Here, we performed comprehensive miRNA profiling in EV71- and CA16-infected human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells at multiple time points using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that 154 known and 47 novel miRNAs exhibited remarkable differences in expression. Of these, 65 miRNAs, including 58 known and 7 novel miRNAs, presented opposite trends in EV71- and CA16-infected samples. Subsequently, we mainly focused on the 56 known differentially expressed miRNAs by further screening for targets prediction. GO and pathway analysis of these targets demonstrated that 18 biological processes, 7 molecular functions, 1 cellular component and 123 pathways were enriched. Among these pathways, Cadherin signalling pathway, Wnt signalling pathway and angiogenesis showed significant alterations. The regulatory networks of these miRNAs with predicted targets, GOs, pathways and transcription factors were determined, which suggested that miRNAs displayed intricate regulatory mechanisms during the infection phase. Consequently, we specifically analysed the hierarchical GO categories of the predicted targets involved in adhesion. The results indicated that the distinct changes induced by EV71 and CA16 infection may be partly linked to airway epithelial barrier function. Taken together, our data provide useful insights that help elucidate the different host-pathogen interactions following EV71 and CA16 infection and might offer novel therapeutic targets for these infections."

Additionally, the composition of the small intestinal microbiota of sucking piglets infected with PEDV showed marked differences from that of the uninfected piglets. Some of the taxa showing differences in abundance between uninfected piglets and piglets infected with PEDV were associated with cellular transport and catabolism, energy metabolism, the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, and amino acid metabolism as determined through the prediction of microbial function based on the bacterial 16S rRNA gene.

Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) causes various clinical manifestations with occasional severe neurological complications. However, the mechanism by which EV-A71 evolves within the human body is unclear. Utilizing deep sequencing and haplotype analyses of viruses from various tissues of an autopsy patient, we sought to define the evolutionary pathway by which enterovirus A71 evolves fitness for invading the central nervous system in humans. Broad mutant spectra with divergent mutations were observed at the initial infection sites in the respiratory and digestive systems.

Understanding selection processes enabling dissemination and accurately estimating EV-A71 diversity during invasion in humans are critical for applications in viral pathogenesis and vaccine studies.

Here, we report a 4-year avian influenza virus (AIV) epidemiological study in ducks in the St. John's region of Newfoundland. The overall prevalence of AIV detection in ducks during this study was 7.2%, with American Black Ducks contributing the vast majority of the collected samples and the AIV positives. The juvenile ducks showed a significantly higher AIV detection rate (10.6%) compared with adults (3.4%). Seasonally, AIV prevalence rates were higher in the autumn (8.4%), but positives were still detected in the winter (4.6%). Preliminary serology tests showed a high incidence of previous AIV infection (20/38, 52.6%). A total of 43 viruses were characterized for their HA-NA or HA subtypes, which revealed a large diversity of AIV subtypes and little recurrence of subtypes from year to year. Investigation of the movement patterns of ducks in this region showed that it is a largely non-migratory duck population, which may contribute to the observed pattern of high AIV subtype turnover. Phylogenetic analysis of 4 H1N1 and one H5N4 AIVs showed these viruses were highly similar to other low pathogenic AIV sequences from waterfowl in North America and assigned all gene segments into American-avian clades. Notably, the H1N1 viruses, which were identified in consecutive years, possessed homologous genomes. Such detection of homologous AIV genomes across years is rare, but indicates the role of the environmental reservoir in viral perpetuation."

We analyzed the clinical presentations of 100 culture-proven CA9-infected patients in 2011 by reviewing their medical records and depicted the CA9 phylogenetic tree. Of the 100 patients with culture-proven CA9 infections, the mean (SD) age was 4.6 (3.4) years and the male to female ratio was 1.9. For clinical manifestations, 96 patients (96%) had fever and the mean (SD) duration of fever was 5.9 (3.4) days. Sixty one patients (61%) developed a skin rash, and the predominant pattern was a generalized non-itchy maculopapular rash without vesicular changes. While most patients showed injected throat, oral ulcers were found in only 19 cases (19%), among whom, 6 were diagnosed as herpangina. Complicated cases included: aseptic meningitis (n=8), bronchopneumonia (n=6), acute cerebellitis (n=1), and polio-like syndrome (n=1). Phylogenetic analysis for current CA9 strains is closest to the CA9 isolate 27-YN-2008 from the border area of mainland China and Myanmar. The most common feature of CA9 during the 2011 epidemic in Taiwan is generalized febrile exanthema rather than herpangina or hand, foot, and mouth disease.

However, the exact contribution of the HN gene to NDV pathogenesis is not known. In this study, the role of the HN gene in NDV virulence was examined. By use of reverse genetics procedures, the HN genes of a virulent recombinant NDV strain, rBeaudette C (rBC), and an avirulent recombinant NDV strain, rLaSota, were exchanged. The hemadsorption and neuraminidase activities of the chimeric viruses showed significant differences from those of their parental strains, but heterotypic F and HN pairs were equally effective in fusion promotion. The tissue tropism of the viruses was shown to be dependent on the origin of the HN protein. The chimeric virus with the HN protein derived from the virulent virus exhibited a tissue predilection similar to that of the virulent virus, and vice versa. The chimeric viruses with reciprocal HN proteins either gained or lost virulence, as determined by a standard intracerebral pathogenicity index test of chickens and by the mean death time in chicken embryos (a measure devised to classify these viruses), indicating that virulence is a function of the amino acid differences in the HN protein. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the virulence of NDV is multigenic and that the cleavability of F protein alone does not determine the virulence of a strain."

Experimentally, live-attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccines demonstrate increased cross-protection compared to inactivated vaccines. However, there is no standardized assay to predict cross-protection following LAIV vaccination. Hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibody in serum is the gold standard correlate of protection following IAV vaccination. LAIV vaccination does not induce a robust serum HI antibody titer; however, a local mucosal antibody response is elicited. Thus, a live-animal sample source that could be used to evaluate LAIV immunogenicity and cross-protection is needed. Here, we evaluated the use of oral fluids (OF) and nasal wash (NW) collected after IAV inoculation as a live-animal sample source in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to predict cross-protection in comparison to traditional serology. Both live-virus exposure and LAIV vaccination provided heterologous protection, though protection was greatest against more closely phylogenetically related viruses. IAV-specific IgA was detected in NW and OF samples and was cross-reactive to representative IAV from each H1 cluster. Endpoint titers of cross-reactive IgA in OF from pigs exposed to live virus was associated with heterologous protection. While LAIV vaccination provided significant protection, LAIV immunogenicity was reduced compared to live-virus exposure. These data suggest that OF from pigs inoculated with wild-type IAV, with surface genes that match the LAIV seed strain, could be used in an ELISA to assess cross-protection and the antigenic relatedness of circulating and emerging IAV in swine."

These microbes interact closely to breakdown plant material that cannot be digested by humans, whilst providing metabolic energy to the host and, in the case of archaea, producing methane. Consequently, ruminants produce meat and milk, which are rich in high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals, and therefore contribute to food security. As the world population is predicted to reach approximately 9.7 billion by 2050, an increase in ruminant production to satisfy global protein demand is necessary, despite limited land availability, and whilst ensuring environmental impact is minimized. Although challenging, these goals can be met, but depend on our understanding of the rumen microbiome. Attempts to manipulate the rumen microbiome to benefit global agricultural challenges have been ongoing for decades with limited success, mostly due to the lack of a detailed understanding of this microbiome and our limited ability to culture most of these microbes outside the rumen. The potential to manipulate the rumen microbiome and meet global livestock challenges through animal breeding and introduction of dietary interventions during early life have recently emerged as promising new technologies. Our inability to phenotype ruminants in a high-throughput manner has also hampered progress, although the recent increase in ""omic"" data may allow further development of mathematical models and rumen microbial gene biomarkers as proxies. Advances in computational tools, high-throughput sequencing technologies and cultivation-independent ""omics"" approaches continue to revolutionize our understanding of the rumen microbiome. This will ultimately provide the knowledge framework needed to solve current and future ruminant livestock challenges."

Myoviridae was the most abundant virus family in ballast water, followed Podoviridae and Siphoviridae. We also identified viruses that infect invertebrates, amoebas, and algae in ballast water and in the Busan port water.

In addition, there were giant viruses in all the ballast water samples, especially, identified Megavirus chilensis in New York and Panama, and Pandoravirus salinus in Mexico and Saudi Arabia. These results provide detailed descriptions of the characteristics of the viruses present in ballast water, document significant viral diversity, and indicate the potential translocation of viruses via ballast water."

Twelve strains of influenza A(H1N1pdm09) virus were isolated from people who died presumably from influenza during 2013-2014 epidemic season.

The bacterial components of the intestinal microbiome have closely evolved as animals have and in so doing contribute to the overall development and metabolic needs of the animal. The microbiome of the pig has been the subject of many investigations using culture-dependent methods and more recently using culture-independent techniques. A review of the literature is consistent with many of the ecologic principles put forth by Rene Dubos. Animals develop an intestinal microbiome over time and space. During the growth and development of the pig, the microbiome changes in composition in a process known as the microbial succession. There are clear and distinct differences in the composition of the pig intestinal microbiome moving from the proximal end of the intestinal tract to the distal end. The majority (&gt;90%) of the bacteria in the pig intestinal microbiome are from two Phyla: Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. However, the ileum has a high percentage of bacteria in the phylum Proteobacterium (up to 40%). Perturbations to the microbiome occur in response to many factors including stresses, treatment with antibiotics, and diet.</jats:p>"

Since PoAstVs are detected in apparent healthy pigs, the clinical significance of infection is unknown. However, AstVs have recently been associated with a severe neurological disorder in animals, including humans, and zoonotic potential has been suggested. To date, little is known about the epidemiology of PoAstVs among the pig population in Japan. In this report, we present an analysis of nearly complete genomes of 36 PoAstVs detected by a metagenomics approach in the feces of Japanese pigs. Based on a phylogenetic analysis and pairwise sequence comparison, 10, 5, 15, and 6 sequences were classified as PoAstV2, PoAstV3, PoAstV4, and PoAstV5, respectively. Co-infection with two or three strains was found in individual fecal samples from eight pigs. The phylogenetic trees of ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 of PoAstV2 and PoAstV4 showed differences in their topologies. The PoAstV3 and PoAstV5 strains shared high sequence identities within each genotype in all ORFs; however, one PoAstV3 strain and one PoAstV5 strain showed considerable sequence divergence from the other PoAstV3 and PoAstV5 strains, respectively, in ORF2. Recombination analysis using whole genomes revealed evidence of multiple possible intra-genotype recombination events in PoAstV2 and PoAstV4, suggesting that recombination might have contributed to the genetic diversity and played an important role in the evolution of Japanese PoAstVs."

We have developed ""Batch-Learning Self-Organizing Map (BLSOM)"" which can characterize very many, even millions of, genomic sequences on one plane. Influenza virus is one of zoonotic viruses and shows clear host tropism. Important issues for bioinformatics studies of influenza viruses are prediction of genomic sequence changes in the near future and surveillance of potentially hazardous strains. To characterize sequence changes in influenza virus genomes after invasion into humans from other animal hosts, we applied BLSOMs to analyses of mono-, di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide compositions in all genome sequences of influenza A and B viruses and found clear host-dependent clustering (self-organization) of the sequences. Viruses isolated from humans and birds differed in mononucleotide composition from each other. In addition, host-dependent oligonucleotide compositions that could not be explained with the host-dependent mononucleotide composition were revealed by oligonucleotide BLSOMs. Retrospective time-dependent directional changes of mono- and oligonucleotide compositions, which were visualized for human strains on BLSOMs, could provide predictive information about sequence changes in newly invaded viruses from other animal hosts (e.g. the swine-derived pandemic H1N1/09). Basing on the host-dependent oligonucleotide composition, we proposed a strategy for prediction of directional changes of virus sequences and for surveillance of potentially hazardous strains when introduced into human populations from non-human sources. Millions of genomic sequences from infectious microbes and viruses have become available because of their medical and social importance, and BLSOM can characterize the big data and support efficient knowledge discovery."

The immune suppression caused by this virus in young chickens is not always associated with clinical signs of disease. The antigenic variant viruses originally described in the United States typically do not cause clinical signs of disease but can cause a marked immune suppression via the destruction of B lymphocytes. Using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay we conducted a survey of asymptomatic broiler chicken flocks in Europe for IBDV. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the viral protein 2 (VP2) gene of four isolates from Spain and four isolates from France indicated they may be different from the classic and very virulent (vv) IBDV strains found throughout Europe. Nucleotide sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the hypervariable region of the VP2 gene indicated that all eight viruses were more similar to U.S. variant viruses than classic viruses. In two viruses, one from France and one from Spain, threonine was observed at amino acid position 222 and serine was found at position 254. These two substitution mutations are characteristic of Delaware variant viruses. In addition, all eight viruses had mutated amino acid position 318 from glycine to aspartic acid, another substitution mutation commonly found in U.S. variant viruses. Although importation restrictions prevented us from directly testing the antigenicity of these viruses, their nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences suggest they could be antigenically distinctive compared to classic and vvIBDV commonly found in Europe. Confirmation of the presence of antigenic variant IBDV strains in Europe requires additional immunologic studies to elucidate the exact nature of the viral epitopes. Our data support the need for these immunologic studies."

Although this genome segment has been shown to contribute to virulence, little is known about the genetic lineages that exist in the United States. The nucleotide genome segment B sequences of 67 IBDV strains collected from 2002 to 2011 in the United States were examined. Although they were from nine different states, a majority (47) of these viruses were from California. A 722-base pair region near the 5' end of genome segment B, starting at nucleotide 168 and ending at 889, was examined and compared to sequences available in GenBank. The nucleotide sequence alignment revealed that mutations were frequently observed and that they were uniformly spaced throughout the region. When the predicted amino acids were aligned, amino acids at positions 145, 146, and 147 were found to change frequently. Six different amino acid triplets were observed and the very virulent (vv) IBDV strains (based on presence of vvIBDV genome segment A sequence) all had the triplet T145, D146, and N147. None of the non-vvIBDV strains had this TDN triplet. Phylogenetic analysis of the 67 nucleotide sequences revealed four significant genome segment B lineages among the U.S. viruses. One of these included the genome segment B typically found in vvIBDV and three contained non-vvIBDV genome segment B sequences. When the available sequences in GenBank were added to the analysis, two additional lineages were observed that did not contain U.S. viruses; one included viruses from China and the other contained viruses from the Ivory Coast. Although the samples tested do not represent all poultry producing regions in the United States, serotype 1 viruses from states outside California all belonged to one genome segment B lineage. The other three lineages observed in the United States were populated with viruses exclusively found in California, except the serotype 2 lineage, where the type strain was a serotype 2 virus from Ohio. The data provide further evidence for the importance of genome segment B identification during routine molecular diagnosis of all IBDV strains."

Phylogenetic network analysis of Ark isolates showed two predominant groups linked by 2 mutations, consistent with subpopulations found in commercial vaccines for this IBV type. In addition, a number of satellite groups surrounding the two predominant populations were observed for the Ark type virus, which is likely due to mutations associated with the nature of this vaccine to persist in flocks. The phylogenetic network analysis of Mass-type viruses shows two groupings corresponding to different manufacturers vaccine sequences. No satellite groups were observed for Mass-type viruses, which is consistent with no persistence of this vaccine type in the field. At the time of collection, no vaccine was being used for the DMV/1639 type viruses and phylogenetic network analysis showed a dispersed network suggesting no clear change in genetic distribution. Selection pressure analysis showed that the DMV/1639 and Mass-type strains were evolving under negative selection, whereas the Ark type viruses had evolved under positive selection. This data supports the hypothesis that live attenuated vaccine usage does play a role in the genetic profile of similar IB viruses in the field and phylogenetic network analysis can be used to identify vaccine and vaccine origin isolates, which is important for our understanding of the role live vaccines play in the evolutionary trajectory of those viruses."

However, HPAI H5N1 and low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5N2 and H9N3 viruses were isolated from domestic waterfowl during live-bird market (LBM) surveillance in Vietnam in 2001 and 2003. To understand the possible role of these early viruses in the genesis of H5N1 strains infecting people, we performed sequencing and molecular characterization. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the hemagglutinin (HA) genes of two geese HPAI H5N1 strains belonged to clade 3, and their surface glycoprotein and replication complex genes were most closely related (98.5-99.7% homologous) to A/duck/Guangxi/22/01 (H5N1) virus, detected contemporarily in southern China, whilst the M and NS genes were derived from an A/duck/Hong Kong/2986.1/00 (H5N1)-like virus. The H5 HA gene of the duck HPAI H5N1 strain belonged to clade 5 and acquired a gene constellation from A/quail/Shantou/3846/02 (H5N1), A/teal/China/2978.1/02 (H5N1) and A/partridge/Shantou/2286/03 (H5N1)-like viruses. The phylogenetic analysis further indicated that all eight gene segments of goose and duck HPAI H5N1 and LPAI H5N2 viruses were distinct from those of H5N1 clade-1 viruses known to have caused fatal human infections in Vietnam since late 2003. The duck H9N3 isolates derived genes from aquatic-bird influenza viruses, and their H9 HA belonged to the Korean lineage. The PB2 gene of A/duck/Vietnam/340/01 (H9N3) virus had lysine at position 627. Based on the molecular characterization of specific amino acid residues in the surface and relevant internal protein-coding genes, the Vietnamese H5N1 and H9N3 virus isolates indicated specificity to avian cell surface receptor and susceptibility for currently licensed anti-influenza A virus chemotherapeutics. Our findings suggest that the H5N1 and H5N2 viruses that circulated among geese and ducks in LBMs in Hanoi, Vietnam, during 2001 and 2003 were not the immediate ancestors of the clade-1 viruses associated with fatal human infections in Vietnam. The clade-1 HPAI H5N1 viruses were independently introduced into Vietnam."

Besides, all the viruses, except Aomori/422/07 H1N1, contain PSIQSRâGLF motif usually found in avian, porcine, and human H1 strains. The Aomori/422/07 H1N1 has a PSVQSRâGLF motif identical to a North American strain. This findings linked to an important intercontinental, Asian-American biogeographical interface. Phylogenetically all the viruses were clustered in Eurasian lineage. Cocirculation of allele A and B (NS gene) viruses was evident in the study implying the existence of a wide reservoir of influenza A viruses in pintail wintering in Japan."

The nature and molecular epidemiology of NDVs prevalent in recent outbreaks in India is poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize NDVs prevalent in vaccinated flocks in India using whole-genome sequencing and biological pathotyping. Twelve field isolates were collected from outbreaks which occurred in different parts of India and characterized as velogenic based on their intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and amino acid sequence at the F protein cleavage site. All 12 of the field isolates and five commonly used vaccine strains were selected for whole-genome sequencing using Ion Torrent PGM technology, yielding complete genome sequences for ten field isolates and all vaccine strains. The genome of all isolates was found to be 15Â 192 nt long with a high level of conservation across multiple genomic features with APMV-I viruses. Phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary distance calculations placed the isolates in genotypes II, IV and XIII. Revisiting other recently reported strains provided preliminary evidence of genotypes VI, VII and XVIII circulating in India. Comparison between the field and vaccine virus sequences revealed unique genomic and amino acid differences in important antigenic regions of the F and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) genes which can be targeted for site directed mutagenesis to evaluate the impact of these substitutions on virus pathogenicity. This study highlights the requirement to evaluate current vaccines through systematic protection assays to determine protection efficacy against field isolates."

In order to choose suitable field isolate as candidate vaccine strain, anti-sera against representative isolates from both the genotypes and two in-use vaccine strains are tested in neutralization assay. Two candidate vaccine strains from both the genotypes are selected with close antigenic match to the field isolates. From the result it is evident that IND 81/00 (genotypes VII), gave a better antigenic coverage (antigenic relationship (r)-value>0.40 with 79% of isolates of 2002--2003) than IND 258/99 (genotype VI; r-value>0.40 with 42% of 2002--2003 isolates).

The exact time and source of the virus introduction to farm A could not be determined with absolute certainty. Possible sources of the infection included backyard goose eggs that had been delivered to farm A for subcontract incubation and hatching, wild geese that frequented the flock of breeding geese on pasture on farm A, and a clutch of Canada goose eggs (Branta canadensis) that had been produced by wild geese and was hatched in the same machine as the eggs produced by farm A."

          <jats:p>
            In February 2013, very severe acute clinical symptoms were observed in calves, heifers, and dairy cattle in several farms in North Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony, Germany. Deep sequencing revealed the coexistence of three distinct genome variants within recent highly virulent bovine viral diarrhea virus type 2 (BVDV-2) isolates. While the major portion (ca. 95%) of the population harbored a duplication of a 222-nucleotide (nt) segment within the p7-NS2-encoding region, the minority reflected the standard structure of a BVDV-2 genome. Additionally, unusual mutations were found in both variants, within the highly conserved p7 protein and close to the p7-NS2 cleavage site. Using a reverse genetic system with a BVDV-2a strain harboring a similar duplication, it could be demonstrated that during replication, genomes without duplication are generated
            <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic>
            from genomes with duplication. The major variant with duplication is compulsorily escorted by the minor variant without duplication. RNA secondary structure prediction allowed the analysis of the unique but stable mixture of three BVDV variants and also provided the explanation for their generation. Finally, our results suggest that the variant with duplication plays the major role in the highly virulent phenotype.

            This study emphasizes the importance of full-genome deep sequencing in combination with manual in-depth data analysis for the investigation of viruses in basic research and diagnostics. Here we investigated recent highly virulent bovine viral diarrhea virus isolates from a 2013 series of outbreaks. We discovered a unique special feature of the viral genome, an unstable duplication of 222 nucleotides which is eventually deleted by viral polymerase activity, leading to an unexpectedly mixed population of viral genomes for all investigated isolates. Our study is of high importance to the field because we demonstrate that these insertion/deletion events allow another level of genome plasticity of plus-strand RNA viruses, in addition to the well-known polymerase-induced single nucleotide variations which are generally considered the main basis for viral adaptation and evolution.

Identification of HPAIVs in wild birds is significant as there is a potential risk of transmission of these viruses to poultry and humans. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Gangjin H5N6 viruses classified into Asian H5 clade 2.3.4.4 lineage and were distinguishable from H5N8 and H5N1 HPAIVs previously isolated in Korea. With the exception of the polymerase acidic (PA) gene, the viruses were most closely related to A/duck/Guangdong/01.01SZSGXJK005-Y/2016 (H5N6) (98.90â~â99.74%). The PA genes of the two novel Gangjin H5N6 viruses were most closely related to AIV isolates previously characterized from Korea, A/hooded crane/Korea/1176/2016 (H1N1) (99.16%) and A/environment/Korea/W133/2006 (H7N7) (98.65%). The lack of more recent viruses to A/environment/Korea/W133/2006 (H7N7) indicates the need for analysis of recent wild bird AIVs isolated in Korea because they might provide further clues as to the origin of these novel reassortant H5N6 viruses. Although research on the origins and epidemiology of these infections is ongoing, the most likely route of infection for the whooper swans was through direct or indirect contact with reassortant viruses shed by migratory wild birds in Korea. As H5N6 HPAIVs can potentially be transmitted to poultry and humans, continuous monitoring of AIVs among wild birds will help to mitigate this risk."

RNA-seq transcriptome comparisons were performed, showing that 1928, 3219 and 2646 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among T3 vs. T0, T7 vs. T0, and T15 vs. T0 respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) analyses of the DEGs from these comparisons, revealed that ORFV might provoke vigorous immune response of the host cells during the early stage of infection. Moreover, GO and network analysis showed that positive and negative regulative mechanisms of apoptosis were integrated in the host cells through up or down-regulating the expression level of DEGs involved in apoptotic pathways, in order to reach a homeostasis of oral mucosa tissues during the exposure to ORFV infection. In conclusion, our study for the first time describes the direct effects of ORFV on the global host gene expression of its host using high-throughput RNA sequencing, which provides a resource for future characterizing the interaction mechanism between the mammalian host and ORFV."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression. MiRNAs relevant with H1N1 SwIV have rarely been reported. To understand the biological functions of miRNAs during H1N1 SwIV infection, this study profiled differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs in pulmonary alveolar macrophages from piglets during the H1N1 SwIV infection using a deep sequencing approach, which was validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Compared to control group, 70 and 16 DE miRNAs were respectively identified on post-infection day (PID) 4 and PID 7. 56 DE miRNAs were identified between PID 4 and PID 7. Our results suggest that most host miRNAs are down-regulated to defend the H1N1 SwIV infection during the acute phase of swine influenza whereas their expression levels gradually return to normal during the recovery phase to avoid the occurrence of too severe porcine lung damage. In addition, targets of DE miRNAs were also obtained, for which bioinformatics analyses were performed. Our results would be useful for investigating the functions and regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in human influenza because pig serves as an excellent animal model to study the pathogenesis of human influenza."

The 174 HEV strains recovered from these viremic rabbits, including two distinct strains each from 23 rabbits, differed from each other by up to 13.6% in a 412-nucleotide (nt) sequence within ORF2, and were 89.3-95.9% identical to the reported rabbit HEV strains in other provinces of China. Three representative Inner Mongolian strains, one each from three phylogenetic clusters, whose entire genomic sequences were determined, shared 79.6-96.7% identities with reported rabbit HEV strains within the entire or 242- to 1349-nt partial genomic sequence. Rabbit HEV strains recovered from liver tissues of rabbits with a high HEV load propagated efficiently in human cell lines (A549 and PLC/PRF/5 cells), suggesting the potential zoonotic risk of rabbit HEV."

Genetic and phenotypic analyses confirmed that the new flavivirus, named Fitzroy River virus, is related to Sepik virus and Wesselsbron virus, in the yellow fever virus group. Most (81%) isolates came from Aedes normanensis mosquitoes, providing circumstantial evidence of the probable vector. In cell culture, Fitzroy River virus replicated in mosquito (C6/36), mammalian (Vero, PSEK, and BSR), and avian (DF-1) cells. It also infected intraperitoneally inoculated weanling mice and caused mild clinical disease in 3 intracranially inoculated mice. Specific neutralizing antibodies were detected in sentinel horses (12.6%), cattle (6.6%), and chickens (0.5%) in the Northern Territory of Australia and in a subset of humans (0.8%) from northern Western Australia."

The detection of HEV-specific antibodies in rats and other rodents has suggested that these animals may represent an additional source for HEV transmission to human. Recently, a novel HEV (ratHEV) was detected in Norway rats from Hamburg, Germany, showing the typical genome organisation but a high nucleotide and amino acid sequence divergence to other mammalian and to avian HEV strains. Here we describe the multiple detection of ratHEV RNA and HEV-specific antibodies in Norway rats from additional cities in north-east and south-west Germany. The complete genome analysis of two novel strains from Berlin and Stuttgart confirmed the association of ratHEV to Norway rats. The present data indicated a continuing existence of this virus in the rat populations from Berlin and Hamburg. The phylogenetic analysis of a short segment of the open reading frame 1 confirmed a geographical clustering of the corresponding sequences. Serological investigations using recombinant ratHEV and genotype 3 capsid protein derivatives demonstrated antigenic differences which might be caused by the high amino acid sequence divergence in the immunodominant region. The high amount of animals showing exclusively ratHEV RNA or anti-ratHEV antibodies suggested a non-persistent infection in the Norway rat. Future studies have to prove the transmission routes of the virus in rat populations and its zoonotic potential. The recombinant ratHEV antigen generated here will allow future seroepidemiological studies to differentiate ratHEV and genotype 3 infections in humans and animals."

The HEV genotypes 1-4 have been subsequently detected in human hepatitis E cases with different geographical distribution and different modes of transmission. Genotypes 3 and 4 have been identified in parallel in pigs, wild boars and other animal species and their zoonotic potential has been confirmed. Until 2010, these genotypes along with avian HEV strains infecting chicken were the only known representatives of the family Hepeviridae. Thereafter, additional HEV-related viruses have been detected in wild boars, distinct HEV-like viruses were identified in rats, rabbit, ferret, mink, fox, bats and moose, and a distantly related agent was described from closely related salmonid fish. This review summarizes the characteristics of the so far known HEV-like viruses, their phylogenetic relationship, host association and proposed involvement in diseases. Based on the reviewed knowledge, a suggestion for a new taxonomic grouping scheme of the viruses within the family Hepeviridae is presented."

Additionally, two putative rotavirus groups (F and G) have been identified in birds. Here, the first nucleotide sequences of the VP6-encoding genome segment of group F (strain 03V0568) and group G (strain 03V0567) rotaviruses, both derived from chickens, are presented. The group F rotavirus is most closely related to avian group A and D rotaviruses, with 49.9-52.3% nucleotide and 36.5-39.0% amino acid sequence identity. The group G rotavirus is most closely related to mammalian group B rotaviruses, with 55.3-57.5% nucleotide and 48.2-49-9% amino acid sequence identity. The terminal sequences of the genome segment were similar in groups A, D and F, and in groups B and G. The findings indicate a long-term evolution of rotavirus groups in two separated clades and support the development of a sequence-based classification system for rotavirus groups."

Next generation sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR amplicons (NGS 16S amplicon analysis) is a powerful culture-independent open reference method that has recently been used to increase understanding of BRD-associated bacteria in the upper respiratory tract of BRD cattle. However, it has not yet been used to examine the microbiome of the bovine lower respiratory tract. The objective of this study was to use NGS 16S amplicon analysis to identify bacteria in post-mortem lung and lymph node tissue samples harvested from fatal BRD cases and clinically healthy animals. Cranial lobe and corresponding mediastinal lymph node post-mortem tissue samples were collected from calves diagnosed as BRD cases by veterinary laboratory pathologists and from clinically healthy calves. NGS 16S amplicon libraries, targeting the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were prepared and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Quantitative insights into microbial ecology (QIIME) was used to determine operational taxonomic units (OTUs) which corresponded to the 16S rRNA gene sequences. Leptotrichiaceae, Mycoplasma, Pasteurellaceae, and Fusobacterium were the most abundant OTUs identified in the lungs and lymph nodes of the calves which died from BRD. Leptotrichiaceae, Fusobacterium, Mycoplasma, Trueperella and Bacteroides had greater relative abundances in post-mortem lung samples collected from fatal cases of BRD in dairy calves, compared with clinically healthy calves without lung lesions. Leptotrichiaceae, Mycoplasma and Pasteurellaceae showed higher relative abundances in post-mortem lymph node samples collected from fatal cases of BRD in dairy calves, compared with clinically healthy calves without lung lesions. Two Leptotrichiaceae sequence contigs were subsequently assembled from bacterial DNA-enriched shotgun sequences. The microbiomes of the cranial lung lobe and mediastinal lymph node from calves which died from BRD and from clinically healthy H-F calves have been characterised. Contigs corresponding to the abundant Leptotrichiaceae OTU were sequenced and found not to be identical to any known bacterial genus. This suggests that we have identified a novel bacterial species associated with BRD."

AIV-H9N2 has not been reported previously in Indonesia. Here we describe the presence of AIV-H9N2 in chicken farms in Indonesia. Ninety-nine cases were observed in various provinces in Indonesia. Clinical signs, pathologic lesions and egg production were recorded. Confirmation was made using virus isolation, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), and sequencing. To construct hemaglutinin (HA) phylogeny, the secondary data of Eurasian lineages were downloaded from GenBank. For neuraminidase, five sequences with the highest similarities with every sequence found in this study were downloaded. Phylogeny was inferred using Neighbor-Joining method in MEGA6 package. Forty-nine AIV-H9N2-positive cases were observed, of which 35 were tested positive for AIV-H9N2 only. The age of the infected chickens was 43.17âÂ±â16.56 weeks, and their egg production was 35.85âÂ±â17.80% lower than before outbreak. BLAST search revealed that the nucleotide sequence of the HA-encoding gene identified in this study shared 98% sequence identity with that of A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/LBM719/2014(H9N2), while its neuraminidase-encoding gene sequences shared 94%, 98%, and 100% identities with three different influenza viruses. The phylogeny shows that the HA of AIV-H9N2 found in this study forms distinct cluster with some Vietnam and China's sequence data. The NA sequence data form three distinct clusters. We conclude that AIV-H9N2 is widespread in many provinces in Indonesia. To lessen economic losses to the poultry industry, flock biosecurity and vaccination against this virus subtype should be implemented rapidly. Thorough and rigid AIV surveillance is paramount to prevent further veterinary and public health consequences of the circulation of this virus in Indonesia."

Here, the results of a screening for coronavirus are presented, using a universal coronavirus RT-PCR, of the bird species graylag goose (Anser anser), feral pigeon (Columbia livia) and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Coronaviruses were found in cloacal swab samples from all the three bird species. In the graylag goose, 40 of 163 sampled birds were coronavirus positive, whereas two of 100 sampled pigeons and one of five sampled mallards tested positive. The infected graylag geese showed lower body weights compared with virus-negative birds, suggesting clinical significance of the infection. Phylogenetic analyses performed on the replicase gene and nucleocapsid protein sequences, indicated that the novel coronaviruses described in the present study all branch off from group III coronaviruses. All the novel avian coronaviruses harboured the conserved s2m RNA structure in their 3' untranslated region, like other previously described group III coronaviruses, and like the SARS coronavirus. Sequencing of the complete nucleocapsid gene and downstream regions of goose and pigeon coronaviruses, evidenced the presence of two additional open reading frames for the goose coronavirus with no sequence similarity to known proteins, but with predicted transmembrane domains for one of the encoded proteins, and one additional open reading frame for the pigeon coronavirus, with a predicted transmembrane domain, downstream of the nucleocapsid gene."

Phylogenetic and statistic evidence.,"Bovine pestiviruses (Bovine Viral Diarrea Virus 1 (BVDV 1) and Bovine Viral Diarrea Virus 2 (BVDV 2)) belong to the genus Pestivirus (Flaviviridae), which is composed of positive stranded RNA viruses causing significant economic losses world-wide. We used phylogenetic and bootstrap analyses to systematically scan alignments of previously sequenced genomes in order to explore further the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for variation in the virus. Previously published data suggested that homologous crossover might be one of the mechanisms responsible for the genomic rearrangements observed in cytopathic (cp) strains of bovine pestiviruses. Nevertheless, homologous recombination involves not just homologous crossovers, but also replacement of a homologous region of the acceptor RNA. Furthermore, cytopathic strains represent dead paths in evolution, since they are isolated exclusively from the fatal cases of mucosal disease. Herein, we report evidence of homologous inter-genotype recombination in the genome of a non-cytopathic (ncp) strain of Bovine Viral Diarrea Virus 1, the type species of the genus Pestivirus. We also show that intra-genotype homologous recombination might be a common phenomenon in both species of Pestivirus. This evidence demonstrates that homologous recombination contribute to the diversification of bovine pestiviruses in nature. Implications for virus evolution, taxonomy and phylogenetics are discussed."

Notably, sequences of the avian retrovirus reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) are frequently found integrated into the genome of FWPV. While some FWPV strains carry remnants of the REV long terminal repeats (LTRs), other strains have been shown to contain insertions of nearly the full-length REV provirus in their genome. In the present study we detected heterogeneous FWPV populations carrying the REV LTR or the near full-length REV provirus genome in a Merriam's wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo merriami). The bird presented papules distributed throughout the non-feathered areas of the head. Avipoxvirus-like virions were observed in the lesions by transmission electron microscopy and the presence of FWPV was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Metagenomic sequencing performed on nucleic acid extracted from the skin lesions revealed two FWPV genome populations carrying either a 197-nt remnant of the REV LTR or a 7939-nt long fragment corresponding to the full-length REV provirus. Notably, PCR amplification using primers targeting FWPV sequences flanking the REV insertion site, confirmed the natural occurrence of the heterogeneous FWPV genome populations in one additional clinical sample from another turkey affected by fowlpox. Additionally, sequencing of a historical FWPV isolate obtained from chickens in the US in 2000 also revealed the presence of the two FWPV-REV genome populations. Results here demonstrate distinct FWPV populations containing variable segments of REV genome integrated into their genome. These distinct genome populations are likely a result of homologous recombination events that take place during FWPV replication."

Five-day-old chicken embryos were infected with this virus, and the chickens developed myeloid leukosis and hemangiomas within 2 months after hatching. To investigate the mechanism of pathogenesis, we employed high-throughput sequencing to analyze proviral integration sites in these tumors. We found expanded clones with integrations in the MET gene in two of the five hemangiomas studied. This integration locus was not seen in previous work characterizing ALV-J-induced myeloid leukosis. MET is a known proto-oncogene that acts through a diverse set of signaling pathways and is involved in many neoplasms. We show that tumors harboring MET integrations exhibit strong overexpression of MET mRNA. These data suggest that ALV-J induces oncogenesis by insertional mutagenesis, and integrations in the MET oncogene can drive the overexpression of MET and contribute to the development of hemangiomas."

Four genes--MYC, MYB, Mir-155, and TERT--have previously been identified as common integration sites in these virus-induced lymphomas and are thought to play a causal role in tumorigenesis. In this study, we employ high-throughput sequencing to identify additional genes driving tumorigenesis in ALV-induced B-cell lymphomas. In addition to the four genes implicated previously, we identify other genes as common integration sites, including TNFRSF1A, MEF2C, CTDSPL, TAB2, RUNX1, MLL5, CXorf57, and BACH2. We also analyze the genome-wide ALV integration landscape in vivo and find increased frequency of ALV integration near transcriptional start sites and within transcripts. Previous work has shown ALV prefers a weak consensus sequence for integration in cultured human cells. We confirm this consensus sequence for ALV integration in vivo in the chicken genome. Avian leukosis virus induces B-cell lymphomas in chickens. Earlier studies showed that ALV can induce tumors through insertional mutagenesis, and several genes have been implicated in the development of these tumors. In this study, we use high-throughput sequencing to reveal the genome-wide ALV integration landscape in ALV-induced B-cell lymphomas. We find elevated levels of ALV integration near transcription start sites and use common integration site analysis to greatly expand the number of genes implicated in the development of these tumors. Interestingly, we identify several genes targeted by viral insertions that have not been previously shown to be involved in cancer."

Virus isolates mostly originated from cattle with one isolate from sheep. The bovine isolates all belonged to BVDV-1, the sheep isolate to BVDV-2. Fifteen isolates formed a new subgroup within BVDV-1, tentatively named BVDV-1l. The remaining bovine isolates were typed as BVDV-1a (n=4), BVDV-1b (n=4), BVDV-1d (n=3), BVDV-1f (n=2) and BVDV-1h (n=1). The isolates allocated to BVDV-1l originated from various geographical regions in different years. There was no correlation between genetic grouping and locations where isolates were obtained. Viruses originating from one farm in most cases belonged to the same subgroup (n=5). This study indicates that the newly detected subgroup BVDV-1l is predominant and widespread in Turkey.

The traditional, serological typing of new isolates by virus neutralisation tests is now in transition to be replaced by PCR and sequencing. The first PCRs, recommended for the detection of adenoviruses, had been designed to target the gene of the major capsid protein, the hexon. In birds, members of three different genera of the family Adenoviridae may occur. Accordingly, three specific hexon PCRs had to be elaborated for the detection of adenoviruses in poultry. A significantly more sensitive PCR, targeting the viral DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene, has been described recently. This method proved to be an efficient alternative for the general detection of adenoviruses irrespective of their genus affiliation. Fowl adenoviruses (FAdVs), isolated from chicken to date, comprise twelve serotypes classified into five virus species (FAdV-A to E). The polymerase gene sequence has been determined yet only from three FAdV types representing three species. In the present work, the panel of polymerase gene sequences was completed with those of the rest of FAdVs. The newly determined sequences will facilitate the identification of new FAdV isolates as an existing species or as a putative new FAdV. Once the polymerase sequence is known, more specific PCRs for the amplification of the hexon and other genes can be designed and performed according to the preliminary species classification."

Our phylogenetic analyses of the E region and complete genome showed that the isolate belongs to JEV genotype 1 (G1). The isolate, JEV/Bo/Aichi/1/2010, was most closely related to several JEV G1 isolates in Toyama Prefecture, Japan in 2007-2009 by the phylogenetic analysis of the E region. In addition, the nucleotide alignment revealed that the deletion in the 3'UTR was the same between JEV/Bo/Aichi/1/2010 and several other JEV G1 isolates identified in Toyama Prefecture in 2008-2009. A hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test was conducted for the detection of anti-JEV antibodies in the affected cow, and the test detected 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME)-sensitive HI antibodies against JEV in the serum of the affected cow. The histopathological investigation revealed nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis in the affected cow, and the immunohistochemical assay detected JEV antigen in the cerebrum. We diagnosed the case as JE of a cow based on the findings of nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis observed in the central nervous system, JEV antigen detected in the cerebrum, JEV isolated from the cerebrum, and 2-ME-sensitive HI antibodies against JEV detected in the serum. This is the first reported case of JE in a cow over 24 months old."

The 793/B IB virus is an important infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) genotype currently circulating in several countries, including Iran. One hundred confirmed IBV samples (between 2014 and 2015; from 15 provinces in Iran) were selected for genotyping based on S1 sequencing. After phylogenetic analysis, it was found that 30% of the IBV isolates belonged to the 793/B genotype. Results showed that the Iranian 793/B-like IBV isolates could be divided in to three clusters: 4/91-like (50%), 1/96-like (40%), and IB88-like (10%). The sequence similarity between Iranian 793/B-like IBV isolates is 87.69%-100%. The highest identity is between the 4/91 and IB88 clusters (96.38%), and the lowest similarity is between the 1/96 and IB88 clusters (87.62%). This study provides a comprehensive analysis of 793/B-type IBV in Iran and characterization of IBV molecular epidemiology in the country."

In the past, human pandemics caused by influenza A viruses had been occurring periodically. Wild aquatic birds are carriers of the full variety of influenza virus A subtypes, and thus, most probably constitute the natural reservoir of all influenza A viruses. Whereas avian influenza viruses in their natural avian reservoir are generally of low pathogenicity (LPAIV), some have gained virulence by mutation after transmission and adaptation to susceptible gallinaceous poultry. Those so-called highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) then cause mass die-offs in susceptible birds and lead to tremendous economical losses when poultry is affected. Besides a number of avian influenza virus subtypes that have sporadically infected mammals, the HPAIV H5N1 Asia shows strong zoonotic characteristics and it was transmitted from birds to different mammalian species including humans. Theoretically, pandemic viruses might derive directly from avian influenza viruses or arise after genetic reassortment between viruses of avian and mammalian origin. So far, HPAIV H5N1 already meets two conditions for a pandemic virus: as a new subtype it has been hitherto unseen in the human population and it has infected at least 438 people, and caused severe illness and high lethality in 262 humans to date (August 2009). The acquisition of efficient human-to-human transmission would complete the emergence of a new pandemic virus. Therefore, fighting H5N1 at its source is the prerequisite to reduce pandemic risks posed by this virus. Other influenza viruses regarded as pandemic candidates derive from subtypes H2, H7, and H9 all of which have infected humans in the past. Here, we will give a comprehensive overview on avian influenza viruses in concern to their zoonotic potential."

Seventy-two sewage samples from two waste water treatment plants were collected from April 2006 through February 2007. Enteroviruses, noroviruses (NoVs) and rotaviruses (RVs) were detected by RT-PCR in 22%, 18% and 8.3% of the samples, respectively. No adenovirus and astrovirus was detected. G2P[8], G9P[8], G1P[8], G2P[4] and rare G12 RV isolates were detected in the environment as well as a bovine RV. The environmental NoV strains mostly belonged to genogroup I (84%). Rotaviruses and some of the NoVs were similar to those found in the clinical samples at the same time. The comparison of environmental and clinical data suggests that similar RV and NoV isolates were circulating in the environment and in the population during the same period. Few studies have investigated the prevalence and the epidemiology of RVs and NoVs in Cairo.

Here we have determined the nucleotide sequence of 3.5 kb from the 3' end of delta gag to the 3' end of molecularly cloned proviral MH2 DNA, in order to elucidate the genetic structure of the virus and to compare it with other mht - and myc-containing oncogenic viruses as well as with the chicken proto-myc gene. The following results were obtained: (i) delta gag- mht forms a hybrid gene with a contiguous reading frame of 2682 nucleotides that terminates with a stop codon near the 3' end of mht . The 3' 969 nucleotides of mht up to the stop codon are 80% sequence related to the onc-specific raf sequence of murine sarcoma virus 3611 (94% homologous at the deduced amino acid level). (ii) The myc sequence is preceded by an RNA splice acceptor site shared with the cellular proto-myc gene, beyond which it is colinear up to a 3'-termination codon and 40 noncoding nucleotides with the myc sequences of avian retrovirus MC29 and chicken proto-myc. Thus, myc forms, together with a 5' retroviral exon, a second MH2-specific gene. (iii) myc is followed by the 3'-terminal c region of about 400 nucleotides, which is colinear with that of Rous sarcoma virus except for a substitution near the 5' end of the long terminal repeat. It is concluded that MH2 contains two genes with oncogenic potential, the delta gag- mht gene, which is closely related to the delta gag-raf transforming gene of MSV 3611, and the myc gene, which is related to the transforming gene of MC29. Furthermore, it may be concluded that the cellular proto-onc genes, which on sequence transduction become viral onc genes, are a small group because among the 19 known onc sequences, 5 are shared by different taxonomic groups of viruses of which the mht /raf homology is the closest determined so far.</jats:p>"

Until 2010, HFMD was predominantly associated with enterovirus (EV) A71 and coxsackievirus (CV) A16 in Japan. In 2011, CV-A6 emerged as a primary causative agent, causing the largest HFMD epidemic in Japan since 1981. Since then, CV-A6 has caused large HFMD epidemics every 2 years. The phylogenetic analysis of complete Viral Protein 1 (VP1) sequences revealed that most CV-A6 strains detected from 2011 to 2015 in Osaka City were classified into a different clade compared with CV-A6 strains detected from 1999 until 2009. The majority of CV-A6 strains detected in 2011 and most CV-A6 strains detected from 2013 to 2015 were mainly divided into two distinct genetic groups. Each epidemic strain carried unique amino acid substitutions in the presumed DE, EF, and GH loops of the VP1 protein that is exposed on the surface of the virion. There is a possibility that the appearance of substitutions on the surface of the virion and an accumulation of a susceptible population are significant factors in recent HFMD epidemics."

In this study, we provide a detailed characterization of full genomes of Egyptian H5N8 viruses and some virological features. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the Egyptian H5N8 viruses are highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the genome of the Egyptian H5N8 viruses was related to recently characterized reassortant H5N8 viruses of clade 2.3.4.4 isolated from different Eurasian countries. Multiple peculiar mutations were characterized in the Egyptian H5N8 viruses, which probably permits transmission and virulence of these viruses in mammals. The Egyptian H5N8 viruses preferentially bound to avian-like receptors rather than human-like receptors. Also, the Egyptian H5N8 viruses were fully sensitive to amantadine and neuraminidase inhibitors. Chicken sera raised against commercial inactivated avian influenza-H5 vaccines showed no or very low reactivity with the currently characterized H5N8 viruses in agreement with the genetic dissimilarity. Surveillance of avian influenza in waterfowl provides early warning of specific threats to poultry and human health and hence should be continued."

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two H1N2 viruses, A/swine/Gunma/1/2013 and A/swine/Ibaraki/1/2013, were reassortants that contain genes from the following three distinct lineages: (i) H1 and nucleoprotein (NP) genes derived from a classical swine H1 HA lineage uniquely circulating among Japanese SIVs; (ii) neuraminidase (NA) genes from human-like H1N2 swine viruses; and (iii) other genes from pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses. The H3N2 virus, A/swine/Miyazaki/2/2013, comprised genes from two sources: (i) hemagglutinin (HA) and NA genes derived from human and human-like H3N2 swine viruses and (ii) other genes from pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis also indicated that each of the reassortants may have arisen independently in Japanese pigs. A/swine/Miyazaki/2/2013 were found to have strong antigenic reactivities with antisera generated for some seasonal human-lineage viruses isolated during or before 2003, whereas A/swine/Miyazaki/2/2013 reactivities with antisera against viruses isolated after 2004 were clearly weaker. In addition, antisera against some strains of seasonal human-lineage H1 viruses did not react with either A/swine/Gunma/1/2013 or A/swine/Ibaraki/1/2013.

Of 1,528 fecal samples analyzed, 21 low-pathogenic AIV were isolated from 2007 to 2009. Nineteen AIV-positive fecal samples were identified as Anseriformes by DNA bar coding. The most frequently isolated subtype was H3 (61.9%), and the most prevalent hemagglutinin/neuraminidase combination was H3N8 (52.4%). Phylogenetic analysis was performed to assess their genetic relationships with those of domestic poultry and wild birds in Korea. The H3 and H7 surface genes belonged to the Eurasian lineage and clustered together in a group with Korean wild birds and poultry. Most N8 genes clustered phylogenetically with viruses isolated in Eurasia, whereas 1 of the Mongolian viruses and some Korean viruses belonged to the North American lineage. The polymerase acidic protein of the internal gene was not distinguishable from the H5N1 highly pathogenic AIV of the goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (Gs/Gd)-like virus.

Genotype VII and genotype IX NDV viruses were the predominant circulating genotype in China, which may possibly be responsible for disease outbreaks in chicken flocks in recent years. While ducks and geese usually have exhibited inapparent infections. In the present study, we investigate the complete genome sequence, the clinicopathological characterization and transmission of two virulent Newcastle disease viruses, SS-10 and NH-10, isolated from domestic ducks in Southern China in 2010. F, and the complete gene sequences based on phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that SS-10 (genotype VII) and NH-10 (genotype IX) belongs to class II. The deduced amino acid sequence was (112)R-R-Q-K/R-R-F(117) at the fusion protein cleavage site. Animal experiment results showed that the SS-10 virus isolated from ducks was highly pathogenic for chickens and geese, but low pathogenic for ducks. It could be detected from spleen, lung, kidney, trachea, small intestine, bursa of fabricius, thymus, pancreas and cecal tonsils, oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs, and could transmit to the naive contact birds. Moreover, it could transmit to chickens, ducks and geese by naive contact. However, the NH-10 virus isolated from ducks could infect some chickens, ducks and geese, but only caused chickens to die. Additionally, it could transmit to the naive contact chickens, ducks, and geese. The two NDV isolates exhibited different biological properties with respect to pathogenicity and transmission in chickens, ducks and geese. Therefore, no species-preference exists for chicken, duck or goose viruses and more attention should be paid to the trans-species transmission of VII NDVs between ducks, geese and chickens for the control and eradication of ND."

To simulate the natural transmission of different kinds of animals in LBMs, we selected three representative NDVs-namely, GM, YF18, and GZ289-isolated from different birds to evaluate the pathogenicity and transmission of the indicated viruses in chickens, ducks, and pigeons. Furthermore, to investigate the replication and shedding of NDV in poultry, we inoculated the chickens, ducks, and pigeons with 10(6) EID50 of each virus via intraocular and intranasal routes. Eight hour after infection, the naÃ¯ve contact groups were housed with those inoculated with each of the viruses as a means to monitor contact transmission. Our results indicated that genetically diverse viruses circulate in LBMs in South China's Guangdong Province and that NDV from different birds have different tissue tropisms and host ranges when transmitted in different birds. We therefore propose the continuous epidemiological surveillance of LBMs to support the prevention of the spread of these viruses in different birds, especially chickens, and highlight the need for studies of the virus-host relationship."

The porcine infection is usually subclinical, but HEV genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic agents that cause sporadic, indigenous human cases of hepatitis E. The aims of this study were to investigate the occurrence and dynamics of HEV infections in young pigs by analyzing a total of 273 fecal samples collected from six farrowing farms, to genetically characterize the HEV isolates obtained, and to examine the phylogenetic relationships of HEV isolates occurring at different swine farms in Finland. Fecal shedding of HEV of individual piglets was followed at two farms that were selected from five farms identified as HEV RNA positive. Excretion of HEV was detected in 87.5% of the piglets during the survey. Piglets contracted primary HEV infection 3-8 weeks after weaning, and at the time they were transferred to fattening farms, practically all (96.6%) of the pigs with a sample available at this occasion still excreted the virus. According to phylogenetic analysis, all HEV isolates obtained belonged to HEV genotype 3, subtype e, and a separate, farm-specific isolate originated from 10 of 11 farms examined. The results of our study show that HEV infections are highly common in young pigs, and HEV RNA-positive pigs enable HEV transmission from farrowing to fattening farms, creating a possible risk of infection for pig handlers, and that genetic variations in HEVs originating from different farms occur."

Although invaluable, the existence of many plausible infection pathways makes this difficult, and epidemiological contact tracing either uncertain, logistically prohibitive, or both. The recent advent of next-generation sequencing technology allows the identification of traceable differences in the pathogen genome that are transforming our ability to understand high-resolution disease transmission, sometimes even down to the host-to-host scale. We review recent examples of the use of pathogen whole-genome sequencing for the purpose of forensic tracing of transmission pathways, focusing on the particular problems where evolutionary dynamics must be supplemented by epidemiological information on the most likely timing of events as well as possible transmission pathways. We also discuss potential pitfalls in the over-interpretation of these data, and highlight the manner in which a confluence of this technology with sophisticated mathematical and statistical approaches has the potential to produce a paradigm shift in our understanding of infectious disease transmission and control."

High biodiversity and bird migration facilitate spread of the pathogen and provide reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases. Current classical diagnostic methods designed to be virus-specific or aim to be limited to group of viral agents, hinder identifying of novel viruses or viral variants. Recently developed approaches of next-generation sequencing (NGS) provide culture-independent methods that are useful for understanding viral diversity and discovery of novel virus, thereby enabling a better diagnosis and disease control. This review discusses the different possible steps of a NGS study utilizing sequence-independent amplification, high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics approaches to identify novel avian viruses and their diversity. NGS lead to the identification of a wide range of new viruses such as picobirnavirus, picornavirus, orthoreovirus and avian gamma coronavirus associated with fulminating disease in guinea fowl and is also used in describing viral diversity among avian species. The review also briefly discusses areas of viral-host interaction and disease associated causalities with newly identified avian viruses."

Between June 2000 and August 2008 echovirus (E) type 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 25, 30, coxsackievirus (CV) -A16, -A19, -B5, and enterovirus 71 (EV71) were reported in Hungary. In this study, 29 previously enterovirus positive samples from 28 patients diagnosed with hand, foot and mouth disease, meningitis and encephalitis, were molecularly typed. The genetic relationships of identified serotypes CV-A16, EV71, and E30 were assessed by direct sequencing of genomic region encoding the capsid protein VP1. The sequences were compared to each other and sequences from other geographical regions possessed in Genbank. The phylogenetic analysis of CV-A16 revealed that the viruses were mostly of Far-Eastern or Asia-Pacific origin. Typing of EV71 showed that one virus from 2000 belonged to genotype C1 and five viruses observed in 2004 and 2005 were identified as genotype C4. The 11 echovirus 30 strains showed homology with those of neighbor European countries. The molecular examination of E30 revealed that three separate lineages circulated in 2000, 2001, and 2004-2006 in Hungary."

We sequenced the full-length protein coding regions of all eight RNA segments from four H3N2 viruses that we isolated from pigs in the Midwestern U.S. between March 1998 and March 1999, as well as from H3N2 viruses recovered from a piglet in Canada in January 1997 and from a pig in Colorado in 1977. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the 1977 Colorado and 1997 Ontario isolates are wholly human influenza viruses. However, the viruses isolated since 1998 from pigs in the Midwestern U.S. are reassortant viruses containing hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and PB1 polymerase genes from human influenza viruses, matrix, non-structural and nucleoprotein genes from classical swine viruses, and PA and PB2 polymerase genes from avian viruses. The HA proteins of the Midwestern reassortant swine viruses can be differentiated from those of the 1995 lineage of human H3 viruses by 12 amino acid mutations in HA1. In contrast, the Sw/ONT/97 virus, which did not spread from pig-to-pig, lacks 11 of these changes."

The aim of the present study was to use viral metagenomics to examine a potential viral involvement in this diarrhoea and to describe the intestinal virome with focus on eukaryotic viruses. Samples from the distal jejunum of 50 diarrhoeic and 19 healthy piglets from 10 affected herds were analysed. The viral fraction of the samples was isolated and nucleic acids (RNA and DNA fractions) were subjected to sequence independent amplification. Samples from diarrhoeic piglets from the same herds were pooled whereas samples from healthy piglets were analysed individually. In total, 29 clinical samples, plus two negative controls and one positive control consisting of a mock metagenome were sequenced using the Ion Torrent platform. The resulting sequence data was subjected to taxonomic classification using Kraken, Diamond and HMMER. In the healthy specimens, eight different mammalian virus families were detected (Adenoviridae, Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae) compared to four in the pooled diarrhoeic samples (Anelloviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae). It was not possible to associate a particular virus family with the investigated diarrhoea. In conclusion, this study does not support the hypothesis that the investigated diarrhoea was caused by known mammalian viruses. The results do, however, indicate that known mammalian viruses were present in the intestine as early as 24-48 hours after birth, indicating immediate infection post-partum or possibly transplacental infection."

Among the eight gene segments of H1N1, hemagglutinin (HA) plays a major role in the attachment of the virus to the host cell surface and entry of viral RNA into the host cell leads to infection. In this study, sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the H1N1 (2009) HA, from Mexico City along with 1952 sequences, from different subtypes of pandemic influenza A virus were studied and results showed that the closest relationship of H1N1 (2009) Mexico strain was with the H1N1 (2007) Mallard Norway strain. Analysis of secondary structures predicted from the protein sequence revealed that diminishing of alpha helixes was observed in many areas of the sequences between the years 2005 to 2010. Conversely, analysis at the structural level is necessary to critically assess the functional significance. Structural level investigation was therefore done for the above said proteins by constructing the 3D structure of these proteins through homology modeling. The models were validated and structural level similarities were evaluated through superimposition. Subsequently, docking studies were done to find the binding mode of the sialic acid (SA) with influenza HA. Molecular dynamics simulations were executed to study the interactions of SA molecule with the HA. Energetic analysis reveals that van der Waal interaction is more favorable for binding of HA with SA of the whole influenza virus. Binding pocket analysis shows that intensities of H-bond donor and acceptor are more in H1N1 (2009)."

However, using pig organs in humans poses risks including unwanted cross-species transfer of viruses and adaption of these pig viruses to the human organ recipient. Recent developments in the field of virology, including the advent of metagenomic techniques to characterize entire viromes, have led to the identification of a plethora of viruses in many niches. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses are the largest group prevalent in virome studies in mammals. Specifically, the ssDNA viral genomes are characterized by a high rate of nucleotide substitution, which confers a proclivity to adapt to new hosts and cross-species barriers. Pig-associated ssDNA viruses include torque teno sus viruses (TTSuV) in the Anelloviridae family, porcine parvoviruses (PPV), and porcine bocaviruses (PBoV) both in the family of Parvoviridae, and porcine circoviruses (PCV) in the Circoviridae family, some of which have been confirmed to be pathogenic to pigs. The risks of these viruses for the human recipient during xenotransplantation procedures are relatively unknown. Based on the scant knowledge available on the prevalence, predilection, and pathogenicity of pig-associated ssDNA viruses, careful screening and monitoring are required. In the case of positive identification, risk assessments and strategies to eliminate these viruses in xenotransplantation pig stock may be needed."

The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the gene were highly conserved among the Japanese strains, regardless of the year of isolation, and were closely related to the Taiwanese strains. By phylogenetic analysis, the Japanese and Taiwanese strains were classified clearly into three chronological clusters: 1966, 1984-1989 and 1996-2004, indicating that the epidemics of bovine ephemeral fever may occur almost simultaneously in both countries by the same genotype. On the other hand, the Australian strains were distantly related to these East Asian strains and placed in the independent fourth cluster of the phylogenetic tree. It is suggested that three amino acid substitutions at residues 224, 271 and 499 in the neutralizing epitopes, of which two generate new glycosylation sequences, are responsible for antigenic variations of bovine ephemeral fever virus. The cross-neutralization test using the bovine ephemeral fever virus isolated in Japan demonstrated that the vaccine developed based on the oldest Japanese strain, YHL, appears to still be effective for controlling bovine ephemeral fever in Japan."

We report here the evolution assessment of codon usage patterns in virus-host system in avian rotavirus (AvRV) of species RVA, RVD, RVF and RVG (preferentially affecting birds). The nucleotide contents, codon usage bias (CUB), relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), and effective number of codons (ENCs) values were investigated targeting overexpressing major inner capsid viral protein (VP6) of these AvRV species. The results confirm that the evolutionary characteristics influences the rotavirus (RV) genetic diversity and impact of host's natural selection on the AvRVs codons. Synonymous codon usage patterns were evaluated following multivariate statistical procedures on all available AvRV coding gene sequences. RSCU trees accommodated all AvRV species and preferred host sequences in one topology confirming greater imminence of AvRVs with the host chicken cell genes. Similarly, the codon adaptation index (CAI) results also displayed a higher adaptation of AvRVs to its chicken host. The codon preference analysis of RVs revealed that VP6 gene express more proficiently in the yeast system, whereas, codon optimization might be required for the effectual expression in Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens. The findings provide basic evidence on the dynamics of AvRV evolution and its host adaptation, which could be exploited for additional research on avian species in future."

Investigations of CRISPR distribution and characterization to date have focused on pathogenic bacteria, while less is known about CRISPR in commensal bacteria, where they may have a significant role in the ecology of the microbiota of humans and other animals, and act as a recorder of interactions between bacteria and viruses. A combination of PCR and sequencing was used to determine prevalence and distribution of CRISPR arrays in Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus hirae isolates from the feces of healthy pigs. Both type II CRISPR-Cas and Orphan CRISPR (without Cas genes) were detected in the 195 isolates examined. CRISPR-Cas was detected in 52 (46/88) and 42 % (45/107) E. faecalis and E. hirae isolates, respectively. The prevalence of Orphan CRISPR arrays was higher in E. faecalis isolates (95 %, 84/88) compared with E. hirae isolates (49 %, 53/107). Species-specific repeat sequences were identified in Orphan CRISPR arrays, and 42 unique spacer sequences were identified. Only two spacers matched previously characterized pig virome sequences, and many were apparently derived from chromosomal sequences of enterococci. Surprisingly, 17 (40 %) of the spacers were detected in both species. Shared spacer sequences are evidence of a lack of species specificity in the agents and mechanisms responsible for integration of spacers, and the abundance of spacer sequences corresponding to bacterial chromosomal sequences reflects interspecific interactions within the intestinal microbiota."

Plasmids often serve as mediators of lateral gene transfer, a process considered to be a strong and sculpting evolutionary force in microbial environments. Our aim was to characterize the overall plasmid population in the environment of the bovine rumen, which houses a complex and dense microbiota that holds enormous significance for humans. We developed a procedure for the isolation of total rumen plasmid DNA, termed rumen plasmidome, and subjected it to deep sequencing using the Illumina paired-end protocol and analysis using public and custom-made bioinformatics tools. A large number of plasmidome contigs aligned with plasmids of rumen bacteria isolated from different locations and at various time points, suggesting that not only the bacterial taxa, but also their plasmids, are defined by the ecological niche. The bacterial phylum distribution of the plasmidome was different from that of the rumen bacterial taxa. Nevertheless, both shared a dominance of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. Evidently, the rumen plasmidome is of a highly mosaic nature that can cross phyla. Interestingly, when we compared the functional profile of the rumen plasmidome to two plasmid databases and two recently published rumen metagenomes, it became apparent that the rumen plasmidome codes for functions, which are enriched in the rumen ecological niche and could confer advantages to their hosts, suggesting that the functional profiles of mobile genetic elements are associated with their environment, as has been previously implied for viruses.</jats:p>"

Only a portion of above amplified PCR products of the F and HN genes (374 and 1713 bp) and their deduced amino acid residues were compared with the other 60 NDVs retrieved from GenBank. Most (29/30) of the recent Taiwanese isolates were clustered in subgenotype VIIe while only one isolate was classified as subgenotype VIIc. All the 29 isolates of subgenotype VIIe were further subclassified and termed provisionally as sub-subgenotypes VIIe2 (13 isolates), VIIe3 (5 isolates), and VIIe4 (11 isolates). The sub-subgenotype VIIe2 isolates possessing the motif (112)R-R-Q-K-R-F(117) and amino acid residue substitutions at positions 23 (L to F) and 90 (T to A) were collected during 2002-2005.

The sub-subgenotype VIIe2 and VIIe4 viruses are now dominant and have been implicated in most of the recent ND outbreaks in Taiwan. Phylogenetic analysis of these isolates revealed that they may have evolved from previously reported local strains (VIIe1). This finding is essential for improving the disease control strategies and development of vaccines for ND."

Although the vaccines protect pigs against the disease, they do not lead to sterilizing immunity and therefore infections with PCV2 continue in farms. It is expected that, due to its high evolutionary rate, PCV2 can adapt quickly to environmental pressures such as vaccination. The goal of this study was to elucidate the molecular variation of PCV2 in relation to vaccination. PCV2 variability was investigated from samples of infected pigs from five farms where vaccination had never been applied and two farms where pigs had been vaccinated for at least 2 years. For the genetic analysis, full PCV2 genomes were amplified and subsequently pooled by vaccination status from serum of eight vaccinated, infected pigs and 16 non-vaccinated, infected pigs. Variability of viral populations was quantified using next-generation sequencing and subsequent bioinformatics analysis. The number of segregating sites was similar in the non-vaccinated (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>â=â109) and vaccinated pools (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>â=â96), but the distribution of these sites in the genome differed. Most notably, in the capsid gene, the number of segregating sites was observed only in the non-vaccinated population. Based on the structural analysis, it is expected that some low-frequency amino acids result in biologically low-fit viruses. On the contrary, D294 in replicase represents a novel amino acid which was dominant and unique in the vaccinated pool. This work showed that variable PCV2 populations were circulating in commercial farms, and that this variability was different in samples obtained from vaccinating and non-vaccinating farms.</jats:p>"

Aichi virus 1 has been reported to be associated with variety types of clinical illnesses including diarrhea, vomiting, fever, purulent conjunctivitis, and respiratory symptoms. The studies from Japan, Spain, Germany, and Tunisia demonstrated that high antibody prevalence against Aichi virus 1 were found in the populations. Aichivirus B or previously known as bovine kobuvirus was first reported in 2003. Since then, Aichivirus B has also been reported from several countries worldwide. An overall prevalence of Aichivirus B varies from 1 to 34.5Â %, and the highest prevalence was found in cattle with diarrhea in Korea. Aichivirus C or porcine kobuvirus is widely distributed in pigs.

Comparable HTS detection of different virus types supports future development of reference virus materials for standardization and validation of different HTS platforms.</jats:p>"

Outbreaks of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) were recorded in different places in the Kamrup district of Assam in India between the years 2012 and 2014. The nucleotide sequences of the 10 CSFV isolates were analyzed based on the partial nucleotide sequences of the E2, 5'NTR and NS5B genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the dominance of subgroup 2.2 along with 2.1 strains in the northeast part of India. Variation in the nucleotide sequences of E2, 5'NTR and 3'NS5B genes of CSFV allows tracking changes in the virus population over time. The study will provide epidemiological information useful for assessing CSFV circulating genogroups in India."

Mainly, wild avian species has always been implicated for the natural reservoir for virus and spread of the disease. In the present study, we report the isolation of Newcastle disease virus (NDV/Peacock/India/2012) in necropsy brain tissue sample of wild peacock from North India. Complete genome of the virus was found to be 15,186 nucleotides (nts) with six genes in order of 3'-N-P-M-F-HN-L-5', which was limited by 55-nts leader region at the 3' end and a 114-nts trailer sequence at 5' end. Sequence analysis of fusion protein revealed the dibasic amino acid cleavage site (112)R-R-Q-K-R-F(117), a characteristic motif of virulent virus. Phylogenetic analysis placed the isolate in genotype II of Newcastle disease virus showing the lowest mean percent divergence (6 %) with other genotype II counterparts. The isolate was characterized as mesogenic (intermediate pathotype) based on the mean death time (63 h) in embryonated chicken eggs and the intra-cerebral pathogenicity index (1.40) in day-old chicks. The report emphasizes the dynamic ecology of NDV strains circulating in a wild avian host during the outbreak of 2012 in North India. Further the genotypic and pathotypical characterizations of the isolate could help in development of homologous vaccine against NDV strain circulating in avian population."

This classification of strains in terms of genome sequence has since proven to be an important tool in the understanding of HBV epidemiology and evolution and has been expanded to include three more genotypes. In parallel with the HBV genotypes described in humans, HBV strains isolated from different primates and hepadnaviruses found in woodchucks, ground squirrels, ducks and herons have been studied. Sequence differences between HBV genotypes can lead to structural differences at the level of the pregenome and can also lead to dramatic differences at the translational level when specific and commonly occurring mutations occur. There is increasing evidence that the clinical picture, the response to treatment and the long-term prognosis may differ depending on which genotype has infected the patient. The consideration of traditional serological patterns in a patient must therefore take the genotype of the infecting strain into account. Nucleotide variability between HBV strains has been used in several studies to trace routes of transmission and, since it is becoming increasingly clear that the differences between HBV genotypes are important, the need for reliable and easy methods of differentiating HBV genotypes has arisen. This review summarizes the knowledge of HBV genotypes with regard to their genetic, structural and clinically significant differences and their origin and evolution in the context of the hepadnaviruses in general.</jats:p>"

The pathways by which the virus has and will spread between countries have been debated extensively, but have yet to be analyzed comprehensively and quantitatively. We integrated data on phylogenetic relationships of virus isolates, migratory bird movements, and trade in poultry and wild birds to determine the pathway for 52 individual introduction events into countries and predict future spread. We show that 9 of 21 of H5N1 introductions to countries in Asia were most likely through poultry, and 3 of 21 were most likely through migrating birds. In contrast, spread to most (20/23) countries in Europe was most likely through migratory birds. Spread in Africa was likely partly by poultry (2/8 introductions) and partly by migrating birds (3/8). Our analyses predict that H5N1 is more likely to be introduced into the Western Hemisphere through infected poultry and into the mainland United States by subsequent movement of migrating birds from neighboring countries, rather than from eastern Siberia. These results highlight the potential synergism between trade and wild animal movement in the emergence and pandemic spread of pathogens and demonstrate the value of predictive models for disease control."

In the field, CIAV strains from breeder farms had no clinical effects, but commercial farm strains were associated with depression, growth retardation, and anemia regardless of the group from which the strain originated. In addition, we identified 7 CIAV genomes that were similar to vaccine strains from vaccinated and unvaccinated breeder flocks. These data suggest that further studies on pathogenicity and vaccine efficacy against the different CIAV group are needed, along with continuous CIAV surveillance and genetic analysis at breeder farms."

The major etiologic agent, however, is unknown. Using metagenomics, we compared the diversity of viruses present in proventriculus samples from flocks diagnosed with TVP to those of healthy flocks in South Korea between 2003 and 2012. Each sample had a mean of 21,538,726 sequence reads generated by high-throughput sequencing, with a mean length of 160 nt. Enrichment in viral sequences suggested that at least three viruses were present in each TVP sample. Although we could not determine a pathogen of TVP that matched the known morphology, picornavirus sequences were present in all five disease samples, suggesting an association with TVP. The five samples yielded 1,045-1,720 bp contigs with 81-84 % nt sequence identity to turkey hepatitis virus (accession number: HM751199). Whole-genome analysis indicated that the QIA01 strain of the novel picornavirus was similar to turkey hepatitis virus in the P2 and P3 regions (82.7 % nt and 95.5 % aa sequence identity), but different in the structural region and partial 2A peptides (56.2 % nt and 23.9 % aa sequence identity). In addition, the QIA01 virus was similar (87.0 % nt and 95.6 % aa sequence identity) to chicken megrivirus, recently detected in chickens with malabsorption syndrome in Hungary. Our results are useful for understanding the genetic diversity of avian picornaviruses and for classifying chicken megrivirus as a pathogen affecting the digestive tract of chickens."

Recently, clinical VZV strains were isolated from Korean patients whose genome was sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technology. In this study, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of VZV strains to genetically characterize Korean clinical isolates. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that three Korean strains, YC01, YC02, and YC03, were linked to clade 2. Comprehensive SNP analysis identified 86 sites specific for the 5 VZV clades. VZV strains isolated from Korea did not form a phylogenetic cluster. Rather, YC02 and YC03 clustered strongly with Chinese strain 84-7 within clade 2, more specifically cluster 2a. Signature sequences for the cluster 2a were identified and found to play an important role in the separation of cluster 2a strains from other clade 2 strains, as shown in substitution studies. Further genetic analysis with additional strains isolated from Japan, China, and other Asian countries would provide a novel insight into the significance of two distinct subclades within clade 2."

Five genotypes of PCV2 were recently identified: PCV2a, PCV2b, PCV2c, PCV2d and PCV2e. In addition, a novel porcine circovirus from a case of a sow with dermatitis, nephropathy syndrome and reproductive failure has been identified based on metagenomic analysis and classified as porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3). Therefore, the current study was conducted to determine the prevalence and genetic characteristics of PCV2 and PCV3 in clinical samples. A total of 471 samples (161 tissue samples of lungs and lymph nodes from 34 farms and 310 serum samples from 47 farms) were tested for PCV2. Among them, 171 samples from 59 farms that had been positive for PCV2 were genotyped. Another 690 samples (296 tissue samples of lungs and lymph nodes from 91 farms, 108 samples of aborted foetuses from 26 farms, and 286 serum samples from 47 farms) were tested for PCV3. Based on PCV2 genotyping results, PCV2d was the most prevalent genotype (107 of 171 samples), and co-infections with combinations of PCV2a, 2b and 2d were identified in 48 samples from 17 farms. A total of 14 samples from 11 farms were also positive for both PCV2 and PCV3. For PCV3, 57 samples (9.8%) from 32 farms (23.2%) were positive. Among the 108 aborted foetuses from 26 farms, only 2 samples were positive for PCV3. Based on sequence comparisons, PCV2d shares 89.6-91.0% and 93.2-94.3% homology with PCV2a and PCV2b, respectively; 98.6-100% homology is shared among PCV2d strains. The PCV3 strains identified in this study share 98.0-99.5% homology. Our study concludes that PCV2d has become the most predominant genotype in Korea. PCV3 was also identified in clinical samples, though no significant association with clinical symptoms was observed in PCV3-positive cases."

Phylogenic analysis revealed that while all viruses clustered into the Eurasian-lineage of H7 avian viruses, at least 12 distinct genotypes were represented. Most H7 viruses contained at least one gene segment from the highly-pathogenic A/Sck/Hong Kong/YU100/02(H5N1)-like avian virus, and they could be separated into at least two antigenic groups. Although we did not detect genetically identical strains, HI assay demonstrated close cross-reactivity of some isolates with the H7N9 viruses from China. Animal studies revealed that most of the genotypes could replicate in the lungs of mice and chickens without prior adaptation and some, particularly H7N4 and H7N7 subtypes, induced mortality in mice. These results reinforce growing pandemic concerns regarding recent H7 viruses and emphasize the importance of continued surveillance of avian influenza viruses in the wild."

In this study, deep sequencing was utilised to characterise the diversity of FMD virus (FMDV) populations in 6 infected cattle present on a single farm during the series of outbreaks in the UK in 2007. A novel RT-PCR method was developed to amplify a 7.6kb nucleotide fragment encompassing the polyprotein coding region of the FMDV genome. Illumina sequencing of each sample identified the fine polymorphic structures at each nucleotide position, from consensus level changes to variants present at a 0.24% frequency. These data were used to investigate population dynamics of FMDV at both herd and host levels, evaluate the impact of host on the viral swarm structure and to identify transmission links with viruses recovered from other farms in the same series of outbreaks. In 7 samples, from 6 different animals, a total of 5 consensus level variants were identified, in addition to 104 sub-consensus variants of which 22 were shared between 2 or more animals. Further analysis revealed differences in swarm structures from samples derived from the same animal suggesting the presence of distinct viral populations evolving independently at different lesion sites within the same infected animal."

Reliable detection of known viruses and discovery of novel divergent viruses from NGS data require dedicated analysis tools that are both sensitive and accurate. Existing software was utilised to design a new bioinformatic workflow for high-throughput detection and discovery of viruses from VIDISCA data. The workflow leverages the VIDISCA library preparation molecular biology, specifically the use of Mse1 restriction enzyme which produces biological replicate library inserts from identical genomes. The workflow performs total metagenomic analysis for classification of non-viral sequence including parasites and host, and separately carries out virus specific analyses. Ribosomal RNA sequence is removed to increase downstream analysis speed and remaining reads are clustered at 100% identity. Known and novel viruses are sensitively detected via alignment to a virus-only protein database, and false positives are removed. A new cluster-profiling analysis takes advantage of the viral biological replicates produced by Mse1 digestion, using read clustering to flag the presence of short genomes at very high copy number. Importantly, this analysis ensures that highly repeated sequences are identified even if no homology is detected, as is shown here with the detection of a novel gokushovirus genome from human faecal matter. The workflow was validated using read data derived from serum and faeces samples taken from HIV-1 positive adults, and serum samples from pigs that were infected with atypical porcine pestivirus."

The seroprevalence to BRSV in Norwegian cattle herds is high, but its role in epidemics of respiratory disease is unclear. The aims of the study were to investigate the etiological role of BRSV and other respiratory viruses in epidemics of BRD and to perform phylogenetic analysis of Norwegian BRSV strains. BRSV infection was detected either serologically and/or virologically in 18 (86%) of 21 outbreaks and in most cases as a single viral agent. When serology indicated that bovine coronavirus and/or bovine parainfluenza virus 3 were present, the number of BRSV positive animals in the herd was always higher, supporting the view of BRSV as the main pathogen. Sequencing of the G gene of BRSV positive samples showed that the current circulating Norwegian BRSVs belong to genetic subgroup II, along with other North European isolates. One isolate from an outbreak in Norway in 1976 was also investigated. This strain formed a separate branch in subgroup II, clearly different from the current Scandinavian sequences. The currently circulating BRSV could be divided into two different strains that were present in the same geographical area at the same time. The sequence variations between the two strains were in an antigenic important part of the G protein. The results demonstrated that BRSV is the most important etiological agent of epidemics of BRD in Norway and that it often acts as the only viral agent. The phylogenetic analysis of the Norwegian strains of BRSV and several previously published isolates supported the theory of geographical and temporal clustering of BRSV."

Future pig genome sequencing projects will reveal multiple novel PERV proviruses from additional breeds and animals. Evaluation of these viral genomes has to be carried out to assess the potential risk of retroviral cross-species infection.

The closely related genus Parechovirus has more recently been associated with human disease. EVs are common commensals of the human gut, often found without any ill effects on the person, but are also associated with a wide range of diseases and syndromes including non-specific rash illnesses, hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), conjunctivitis, meningitis and encephalitis, myocarditis and polio. This results in a significant burden of disease worldwide, often due to a particular genotype of EV. An estimated 1 billion people are infected with EV every year.</jats:p>"

Based on criteria used to differentiate other human and animal picornavirus serotypes, it was discovered that BEV types 1, 4, 5 and 6 were related to each other and could be included in a single serotype. Types 3 and 7 were found to be identical, and related to serotype 2. All of the other nine BEV were included in either serotype 1 or 2. Not all of the strains in each serotype were identical and antigenic variants were designated as subtypes. Antigenic relationships not revealed by VN were demonstrated in CF and IP tests. Bovine enterovirus strains whose antisera had the broadest intratypic reactivity were suggested as prototypes. The two proposed BEV serotypes could also be distinguished by their ability to agglutinate erythrocytes. Guinea pig erythrocytes were agglutinates by both serotypes while sheep red cells only reacted with serotype 1."

Phylogenetic analyses were performed on field viruses originating from naturally infected animals, the BDV vaccine strain âDessauâ, four widely used laboratory strains and the novel BDV subtype No/98. Four regions of the BDV genome were analysed: the complete p40, p10 and p24 genes and the 5â²-untranslated region of the X/P transcript. BDV isolates from the same geographical area exhibited a clearly higher degree of identity to each other than to BDV isolates from other regions, independent of host species and year of isolation. Five different clusters could be established within endemic areas, corresponding to the geographical regions from which the viruses originated: (i) a Swiss, Austrian and Liechtenstein Rhine valley group, related closely to the geographically bordering Baden-Wurttemberg and Bavaria II group (ii) in the western part of Germany; (iii) a third group, called Bavaria I group, limited in occurrence to Bavaria; (iv) a southern Saxony-Anhalt and bordering northern Saxony group, bound to the territories of these federal states in the eastern part of Germany; and (v) a mixed group, consisting of samples from different areas of Germany; however, these were mainly from the federal states of Thuringia and Lower Saxony. The laboratory strains and the vaccine strain clustered within these groups according to their geographical origins.

Chickenpox is the result of primary infection of VZV. During the viremic stage, VZV infects peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and spreads to the periphery. In skin cells it causes typical lesions. Apoptosis has been demonstrated in different cell types by other alpha-herpesviruses. VZV-infected T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and monocytes, respectively, were examined in this in vitro study by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. All infected cell types showed signs of apoptosis: a lower DNA content, DNA fragmentation, loss of membrane integrity, and an altered nuclear morphology.

Nevertheless, little effort has been invested in understanding the characteristics of avian H1N1 influenza viruses. Here, we present the genome sequence and a molecular and virological characterization of an avian influenza A virus, A/wild bird/Korea/SK14/2014 (A/SK14, H1N1), isolated from migratory birds in South Korea during the winter season of 2014-2015. Full-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus belongs to the Eurasian avian lineage. Although it retained avian-receptor binding preference, A/SK14 virus also exhibited detectable human-like receptor binding and was able to replicate in differentiated primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells. In animal models, A/SK14 virus was moderately pathogenic in mice, and virus was detected in nasal washes from inoculated guinea pigs, but not in direct-contact guinea pigs. Although A/SK14 showed moderate pathogenicity and no evidence of transmission in a mammalian model, our results suggest that the dual receptor specificity of A/SK14-like virus might allow for a more rapid adaptation to mammals, emphasizing the importance of further continuous surveillance and risk-assessment activities."

Despite 35 years of research, the definitive etiologic agent associated with the disease process is still unknown. Previous studies have demonstrated that multiple bacterial species are associated with lesions, with spirochetes being the most reliably identified organism. This study details the deep sequencing-based metagenomic evaluation of 48 staged DD biopsy specimens collected during a 3-year longitudinal study of disease progression. Over 175 million sequences were evaluated by utilizing both shotgun and 16S metagenomic techniques. Based on the shotgun sequencing results, there was no evidence of a fungal or DNA viral etiology. The bacterial microbiota of biopsy specimens progresses through a systematic series of changes that correlate with the novel morphological lesion scoring system developed as part of this project. This scoring system was validated, as the microbiota of each stage was statistically significantly different from those of other stages (P < 0.001). The microbiota of control biopsy specimens were the most diverse and became less diverse as lesions developed. Although Treponema spp. predominated in the advanced lesions, they were in relatively low abundance in the newly described early lesions that are associated with the initiation of the disease process. The consortium of Treponema spp. identified at the onset of disease changes considerably as the lesions progress through the morphological stages identified. The results of this study support the hypothesis that DD is a polybacterial disease process and provide unique insights into the temporal changes in bacterial populations throughout lesion development."

Based on our results and existing classification criteria for the genus Orthoreovirus, the tortoise reovirus strain CH1197/96 might be the first representative of a novel reptilian origin Orthoreovirus species."

A possible reservoir of mammalian Borna disease virus has been identified, divergent bornaviruses have been detected in birds and reptiles, and endogenous bornavirus-like elements have been discovered in the genomes of vertebrates of several species. Previous sequence comparisons and alignments have indicated that the members of the current family Bornaviridae are phylogenetically diverse and are not adequately classified in the existing bornavirus taxonomy supported by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). We provide an update of these analyses and describe their implications for taxonomy. We propose retaining the family name Bornaviridae and the genus Bornavirus but reorganizing species classification. PAirwise Sequence Comparison (PASC) of bornavirus genomes and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) comparison of genomic and protein sequences, in combination with other already published phylogenetic analyses and known biological characteristics of bornaviruses, indicate that this genus should include at least five species: Mammalian 1 bornavirus (classical Borna disease virus and divergent Borna disease virus isolate No/98), Psittaciform 1 bornavirus (avian/psittacine bornaviruses 1, 2, 3, 4, 7), Passeriform 1 bornavirus (avian/canary bornaviruses C1, C2, C3, LS), Passeriform 2 bornavirus (estrildid finch bornavirus EF), and Waterbird 1 bornavirus (avian bornavirus 062CG). This classification is also in line with biological characteristics of these viruses and their vertebrate hosts. A snake bornavirus, proposed to be named Loveridge's garter snake virus 1, should be classified as a member of an additional species (Elapid 1 bornavirus), unassigned to a genus, in the family Bornaviridae. Avian bornaviruses 5, 6, MALL, and another ""reptile bornavirus"" (""Gaboon viper virus"") should stay unclassified until further information becomes available. Finally, we propose new virus names and abbreviations when necessary to achieve clear differentiation and unique identification."

This genus includes four species as the taxonomic homes for equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), respectively. A revision of this classification is urgently needed to accommodate the recent description of eleven highly divergent simian arteriviruses in diverse African nonhuman primates, one novel arterivirus in an African forest giant pouched rat, and a novel arterivirus in common brushtails in New Zealand. In addition, the current arterivirus nomenclature is not in accordance with the most recent version of the International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature. Here we outline an updated, amended, and improved arterivirus taxonomy based on current data. Taxon-specific sequence cut-offs are established relying on a newly established open reading frame 1b phylogeny and pairwise sequence comparison (PASC) of coding-complete arterivirus genomes. As a result, the current genus Arterivirus is replaced by five genera: Equartevirus (for EAV), Rodartevirus (LDVÂ +Â PRRSV), Simartevirus (SHFVÂ +Â simian arteriviruses), Nesartevirus (for the arterivirus from forest giant pouched rats), and Dipartevirus (common brushtail arterivirus). The current species Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus is divided into two species to accommodate the clear divergence of the European and American ""types"" of PRRSV, both of which now receive virus status. The current species Simian hemorrhagic fever virus is divided into nine species to accommodate the twelve known simian arteriviruses. Non-Latinized binomial species names are introduced to replace all current species names to clearly differentiate them from virus names, which remain largely unchanged."

Pathologic findings included erosive-ulcerative stomatitis, fibrino-necrotic tracheitis, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, multifocal coagulation necroses in the liver, and severe lymphocytolysis in lymphoid tissues. Syncytial cells were conspicuous, especially in the oral mucosa, pulmonary alveoli, liver, and lymphoid tissues. In addition to the typical tissue distribution, eosinophilic intracytoplasmic and/or intranuclear inclusions were observed in epithelial cells lining the renal pelvis and abomasal mucosa. Immunolabeling of the viral antigen was observed in the kidney, brain, rumen, abomasum, heart, and myocytes of the tongue besides its more typical locations. In this study, we report and describe in detail the first peste des petits ruminants endemic in Kirikkale Province, Central Anatolia of Turkey. In conclusion, these previously unreported pathologic findings in natural peste des petits ruminants virus infection establish a basis for resemblance to other morbillivirus infections, such as canine distemper and distemper of sea mammals. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that the 448-bp genome fragment was amplified in 18 cases (18/21, 85.7 %).

Here, we report antigenic and genetic characterization of two H6N2 viruses isolated from apparently healthy domestic ducks in Kerala and Assam, India during 2014 and 2015, respectively. Hemagglutination inhibition assay revealed antigenic divergence between the two isolates, which was corroborated by amino acid differences at 55 positions (15.98%) between their hemagglutinin (HA) 1.The sequence analyses indicated that both the viruses are avian origin with avian receptor specificity, low pathogenic to poultry and sensitive to oseltamivir. However, Kerala14 had V27I mutation marker for amantadine resistance in M2. The Assam15 virus had an additional N-linked glycosylation on HA2 (position 557) compared to Kerala14 virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene revealed that both the viruses belonged to distinct lineages (Eurasian and Asia II). Phylogeny of neuraminidase and internal gene segments revealed that both the viruses are novel reassortants and are genetically distinct with different gene constellations. The results suggest independent introductions of the two H6N2 viruses into India and migratory wild birds in the Central Asian flyway might be the source of H6N2 viruses in ducks in India. Therefore, continued AIV surveillance in poultry and wild birds is essential for early detection of emergence of novel strains with pandemic potential and control of their spread."

The virus is classified into four genotypes (1-4) with one serotype. Genotypes 1 and 2 exclusively infect humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 also infect other animals, particularly pigs. In endemic areas, large outbreaks of acute hepatitis caused by viruses of genotype 1 or 2 frequently occur due to fecal-oral transmission, usually through contamination of drinking water. With a high attack rate in young adults (aged 15-45 years), the disease is particularly severe among pregnant women (20-30% mortality). HEV appears to be a zoonotic disease, with transmission from pigs, wild boars, and deer, or foodborne. Chronic infections are rare, except in immunosuppressed persons, such as organ transplant recipients. A subunit vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing the clinical disease, but is not yet commercially available. Our understanding of HEV has undergone major changes in recent years and in this article we review the currently available information with regard to the molecular biology, pathobiology, and epidemiology of HEV infection. We also review the current therapeutic interventions and strategies being used to control HEV infection, with emphasis on possible approaches that could be used to develop an effective vaccine against HEV."

Similar to the DRV ÏB-encoded gene (1201Â bp long) previously identified, the three other double-stranded RNA small genome segments of DRV have been cloned and sequenced. They were 1325, 1191 and 1124Â bp long, respectively, and contained conserved terminal sequences common to ARVs. They coded for single expression products, except the smallest (S4), which contained two overlapping open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2). BLAST analyses revealed that the proteins encoded by the 1325 and 1191Â bp genes shared high identity levels with ARV ÏA and ÏNS, respectively, and to a lesser extent with other orthoreovirus counterparts. No homology was found for the S4 ORF1-encoded p10 protein. The 29Â·4Â kDa product encoded by S4 ORF2 appeared to be 25% identical to ARV S1 ORF3-encoded ÏC, a cell-attachment oligomer inducing type-specific neutralizing antibodies. Introduction of large gaps in the N-terminal part of the DRV protein was necessary to improve DRV and ARV ÏC amino acid sequence alignments. However, a leucine zipper motif was conserved and secondary structure analyses predicted a three-stranded Î±-helical coiled-coil feature at this amino portion. Thus, despite extensive sequence divergence, DRV ÏC was suggested to be structurally and probably functionally related to ARV ÏC. This work provides evidence for the diversity of the polycistronic S class genes of reoviruses isolated from birds and raises the question of the relative classification of DRV in the <jats:italic>Orthoreovirus</jats:italic> genus.</jats:p>"

Phylogenetic analysis with internal genes showed that some Korean isolates formed a cluster with other subtypes, such as H5N1, H6N1, and H6N2 in China and Taiwan.

The objective of this study was to determine the susceptibility and pathogenesis of chickens and domestic ducks to A/Whooper Swan/Mongolia/224/05 (H5N1) high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) virus when administered through respiratory or alimentary routes of exposure. The chickens and ducks were more susceptible to the H5N1 HPAI virus, as evidenced by low infectious and lethal viral doses, when exposed by intranasal as compared to alimentary routes of inoculation (intragastric or oral-fed infected chicken meat). In the alimentary exposure pathogenesis study, pathologic changes included hemorrhage, necrosis, and inflammation in association with virus detection. These changes were generally observed in most of the visceral organs of chickens, between 2 and 4 days postinoculation (DPI), and are similar to lesions and virus localization seen in birds in natural cases or in experimental studies using the intranasal route. Alimentary exposure to the virus caused systemic infection in the ducks, characterized by moderate lymphocytic encephalitis, necrotized hepatitis, and pancreatitis with a corresponding demonstration of virus within the lesions. In both chickens and ducks with alimentary exposure, lesions, virus, or both were first demonstrated in the upper alimentary tract on 1 DPI, suggesting that the alimentary tract was the initial site affected upon consumption of infected meat or on gavage of virus in liquid medium. However, as demonstrated in the infectivity study in chickens, alimentary infection required higher exposure doses to produce infection as compared to intranasal exposure in chickens. These data suggest that upper respiratory exposure to H5N1 HPAI virus in birds is more likely to result in virus infection and transmission than will consumption of infected meat, unless the latter contains high doses of virus, as found in cannibalized infected carcasses."

Our major aims were to clarify the occurrence of the three SIV subtypes - H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 - at regional levels, to identify novel reassortant viruses and to antigenically compare SIVs with human H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses. Lung tissue and/or nasal swabs from outbreaks of acute respiratory disease in pigs were investigated by virus isolation. The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were determined using standard methods. Of the total 169 viruses, 81 were classified as 'avian-like' H1N1, 36 as human-like H3N2 and 47 as human-like H1N2. Only five novel reassortant viruses were identified: two H1N1 viruses had a human-like HA and three H1N2 viruses an avian-like HA. All three SIV subtypes were detected in Belgium, Italy and Spain, while only H1N1 and H1N2 viruses were found in UK and Northwestern France. Cross-hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests with hyperimmune sera against selected older and recent human influenza viruses showed a strong antigenic relationship between human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses from the 1980s and H1N2 and H3N2 human-like SIVs, confirming their common origin. However, antisera against human viruses isolated during the last decade did not react with currently circulating H1 or H3 SIVs, suggesting that especially young people may be, to some degree, susceptible to SIV infections."

The Simbu serogroup currently consists of a highly diverse group of related arboviruses that infect both humans and economically important livestock species.

Phylogenetic and pairwise divergence analyses indicated the presence of high levels of genetic diversity within these two species complexes, on a par with that seen among the five other species complexes in the Simbu serogroup. Based on previously reported divergence thresholds between species, the data suggested that these two complexes should actually be divided into at least five species. Together these five species formed a distinct phylogenetic clade apart from the rest of the Simbu serogroup. Pairwise sequence divergences among viruses of this clade and viruses in other Simbu serogroup species complexes were similar to levels of divergence among the other orthobunyavirus serogroups.

In this study, we sequenced whole genomes of eight H5N1 avian influenza viruses isolated from domestic poultry in eastern China and compared them with those of typical influenza virus strains. Phylogenetic analyses showed that all eight genomes belonged to clade 2.3.2.1 and clade 7.2, the two main circulating clades in China. Viruses that clustered in clade 2.3.2.1 shared a high degree of homology with H5N1 isolates located in eastern Asian. Isolates that clustered in clade 7.2 were found to circulate throughout China, with an east-to-west density gradient. Pathogenicity studies in mice showed that these isolates replicate in the lungs, and clade 2.3.2.1 viruses exhibit a notably higher degree of virulence compared to clade 7.2 viruses. Our results contribute to the elucidation of the biological characterization and pathogenicity of HPAI H5N1 viruses."

CaPV infections produce similar symptoms in sheep and goats, and the three viruses cannot be distinguished serologically. Since there are conflicting opinions regarding the host specificity of CaPVs, particularly for goatpox and sheeppox viruses, the development of rapid genotyping tools will facilitate more accurate disease diagnosis and surveillance for better management of capripox outbreaks. This paper describes a species-specific, real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), based on unique molecular markers that were found in the G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor (GPCR) gene sequences of CaPVs, that uses dual hybridization probes for their simultaneous detection, quantitation and genotyping. The assay can differentiate between CaPV strains based on differences in the melting point temperature (Tm) obtained after fluorescence melting curve analysis (FMCA). It is highly sensitive and presents low intra- and inter-run variation. This real time PCR assay will make a significant contribution to CaPV diagnosis and to the better understanding of the epidemiology of CaPVs by enabling rapid genotyping and gene-based classification of viral strains and unequivocal identification of isolates."

In this study, metagenomic analysis was used to identify and characterise a novel bocaparvovirus in the faeces of rabbits with enteric disease. To assess the prevalence of the novel virus, rectal swabs and faecal samples obtained from rabbits with and without diarrhoea were screened with a specific PCR assay. The complete genome sequence of the novel parvovirus was reconstructed. The virus was distantly related to other bocaparvoviruses; the three ORFs shared 53%, 53% and 50% nucleotide identity, respectively, to homologous genes of porcine bocaparvoviruses. The virus was detected in 8/29 (28%) and 16/95 (17%) samples of rabbits with and without diarrhoea, respectively. Sequencing of the capsid protein fragment targeted by the diagnostic PCR identified two distinct bocaparvovirus populations/sub-types, with 91.7-94.5% nucleotide identity to each other. Including these novel parvoviruses in diagnostic algorithms of rabbit diseases might help inform their potential pathogenic role and impact on rabbit production and the virological profiles of laboratory rabbits."

Most of these HPVs can be classified into three distinct genera, the alpha-, beta- and gamma-papillomaviruses (PVs). Of note, only one or a small number of PVs have been identified for each individual animal species. However, four canine PVs (CPVs) (COPV, CPV2, CPV3 and CPV4) have been described and their entire genomic sequences have been published. Based on their sequence similarities, they belong to three distinct clades. In the present study, circular viral DNA was amplified from three dogs showing signs of pigmented plaques, endophytic papilloma or in situ squamous cell carcinoma. Analysis of the DNA sequences suggested that these are three novel viruses (CPV5, CPV6 and CPV7) whose genomes comprise all the conserved sequence elements of known PVs. The genomes of these seven CPVs were compared in order properly classify them. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses, as well as pairwise sequence alignments of the putative amino acid sequences, revealed that CPV5 grouped well with CPV3 and CPV4, whereas CPV7 grouped with CPV2 but neither group fitted with other classified PVs. However, CPV6 grouped with COPV, a lambda-PV. Based on this evidence, allocation of CPVs into three distinct clades could therefore be supported. Thus, similar to HPVs, it might be that the known and currently unknown CPVs are related and form just a few clades or genera."

These diseases have become important public health concerns in recent years. The tick-borne viruses that cause diseases in humans mainly belong to 3 families: Bunyaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Reoviridae. In this review, we focus on therapeutic approaches for several of the more important tick-borne viruses from these 3 families. These viruses are Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHF) and the newly discovered tick-borne phleboviruses, known as thrombocytopenia syndromevirus (SFTSV), Heartland virus and Bhanja virus from the family Bunyaviridae, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Powassan virus (POWV), Louping-ill virus (LIV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV), Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), and Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV) from the Flaviviridae family. To date, there is no effective antiviral drug available against most of these tick-borne viruses. Although there is common usage of antiviral drugs such as ribavirin for CCHF treatment in some countries, there are concerns that ribavirin may not be as effective as once thought against CCHF. Herein, we discuss also the availability of vaccines for the control of these viral infections. The lack of treatment and prevention approaches for these viruses is highlighted, and we hope that this review may increase public health awareness with regard to the threat posed by this group of viruses."

            Zoonotic diseases are a looming threat to global populations, and nearly 75% of emerging infectious diseases can spread among wildlife, domestic animals and humans. A âOne World, One Healthâ perspective offers us an ideal framework for understanding and potentially mitigating the spread of zoonoses, and the island of Madagascar serves as a natural laboratory for conducting these studies. Rapid habitat degradation and climate change on the island are contributing to more frequent contact among humans, livestock and wildlife, increasing the potential for pathogen spillover events. Given Madagascar's long geographical isolation, coupled with recent and repeated introduction of agricultural and invasive species, it is likely that a number of circulating pathogens remain uncharacterized in lemur populations. Thus, it is imperative that new approaches be implemented for de novo pathogen discovery. To this end, we used non-targeted deep sequencing of blood transcriptomes from two species of critically endangered wild lemurs (
            <jats:italic>Indri indri</jats:italic>
            and
            <jats:italic>Propithecus diadema</jats:italic>
            ) to characterize blood-borne pathogens. Our results show several undescribed vector-borne parasites circulating within lemurs, some of which may cause disease in wildlife, livestock and humans. We anticipate that advanced methods for de novo identification of unknown pathogens will have broad utility for characterizing other complex disease transmission systems.

In some fields, approximately 10% of the plants exhibited viruslike symptoms and suffered greatly reduced seed yields. Lentil (Lens culinaris) was also observed to be infected but not pea (Pisum sativum) or faba bean (Vicia faba) growing in nearby fields. Infected chickpea tissue reacted positively to the potyvirus group-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb), but there was no serological reaction with antisera to the potyviruses Bean yellow mosaic virus, Clover yellow vein virus, Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus, Pea seedborne mosaic virus, Bean common mosaic virus, or Bean common mosaic necrosis virus. Western blots of total protein extracts probed with the potyvirus MAb revealed a single band ca. 32 kDa. Comparative sequence analysis of cDNA clones generated from the putative coat protein gene consisted of 282 amino acids (31.9 kDa) and showed moderate identities of 67, 66, 63, 63, and 61% with the coat proteins of potyviruses Pepper severe mosaic virus, Pepper yellow mosaic virus, Potato virus Y, Plum pox virus, and Pepper mottle virus, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the coat protein amino acid sequence revealed that this virus is a unique member of the family Potyviridae and is phylogenetically most closely related to a group of Solanaceae-infecting potyviruses rather than to other legumeinfecting potyviruses.

Genome analysis revealed evidence of recent interspecies transmission between falcons and their prey, houbara bustards and pigeons, possibly along the food chain, as well as avian-to-swine transmission. Recombination, which is known to occur frequently in some coronaviruses, was also common among these deltacoronaviruses and occurred predominantly at the spike region. Such recombination, involving the receptor binding protein, may contribute to the emergence of new viruses capable of infecting new hosts.

We discovered a previously unknown diversity of picornaviruses in chickens in Hong Kong. Picornaviruses were detected in 87 cloacal and 7 tracheal samples from 93 of 900 chickens by reverse transcription-PCR, with their partial 3D(pol) gene sequences forming five distinct clades (I to V) among known picornaviruses. Analysis of eight genomes from different clades revealed seven different picornaviruses, including six novel picornavirus species (ChPV1 from clade I, ChPV2 and ChPV3 from clade II, ChPV4 and ChPV5 from clade III, ChGV1 from clade IV) and one existing species (Avian encephalomyelitis virus from clade V). The six novel chicken picornavirus genomes exhibited distinct phylogenetic positions and genome features different from related picornaviruses, supporting their classification as separate species. Moreover, ChPV1 may potentially belong to a novel genus, with low sequence homologies to related picornaviruses, especially in the P1 and P2 regions, including the predicted L and 2A proteins. Nevertheless, these novel picornaviruses were most closely related to picornaviruses of other avian species (ChPV1 related to Passerivirus A, ChPV2 and ChPV3 to Avisivirus A and Duck hepatitis A virus, ChPV4 and ChPV5 to Melegrivirus A, ChGV1 to Gallivirus A). Furthermore, ChPV5 represented a potential recombinant picornavirus, with its P2 and P3 regions possibly originating from Melegrivirus A. Chickens are an important reservoir for diverse picornaviruses that may cross avian species barriers through mutation or recombination."

In this work, six serotype A foot-and-mouth disease viruses (FMDV), collected from endemic outbreaks during January and February of 2009 in four different provinces in Vietnam, were genetically characterized for their complete genome sequences. Genetic analysis based on the complete viral genome sequence indicated that they were closely related to each other and shared 99.0-99.8% amino acid (aa) identity. Genetic and deduced aa analysis of the capsid coding gene VP1 showed that the six Vietnamese strains were all classified into the genotype IX from a total of 10 major genotypes worldwide, sharing 98.1-100% aa identity each other. They were most closely related to the type A strains recently isolated in Laos (A/LAO/36/2003, A/LAO/1/2006, A/LAO/6/2006, A/LAO/7/2006, and A/LAO/8/2006), Thailand (A/TAI/2/1997 and A/TAI/118/1987), and Malaysia (A/MAY/2/2002), sharing 88.3-95.5% nucleotide (nt) identities. In contrast, Vietnamese type A strains showed low nt identities with the two old type A FMDVs, isolated in 1960 in Thailand (a15thailand iso43) and in 1975 in the Philippines (aphilippines iso50), ranging from 77.3 to 80.9% nt identity. A multiple alignment based on the deduced amino acid sequences of the capsid VP1 coding gene of type A FMDV revealed three amino acid substitutions between Vietnamese strains and the strains of other Southeast Asian countries (Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines). Alanine was replaced by valine at residue 24, asparagine by arginine at residue 85, and serine by threonine at residue 196.

The viruses were isolated and genetically characterized for their complete genomic sequences. The genetic analysis based on the complete genomic coding sequences revealed that the four serotype O FMDVs were related to each other, sharing 95.2% nucleotide (nt) identity and 97.5-97.6% amino acid (aa) identity. Genetic analysis and a phylogenetic tree, based on the VP1 gene of FMDV, showed that the four present Vietnamese serotype O strains have a high level of identity with other serotype O representatives of the Mya-98 lineage of the Southeast Asian (SEA) topotype. The four viruses were all clustered into the Mya-98 lineage of the SEA topotype, sharing 92.3-95.6% nt and 93.4-96.7% aa identity. This finding of the Mya-98 lineage was different from previous reports that the Vietnamese serotype O strains belonged to the Cam-94 lineage of the SEA topotype and two other topotypes, Middle East-South Asia (ME-SA) and Cathay. For the two serotype Asia 1 FMDVs, the genetic analysis based on the complete genomic coding sequences as well as on the VP1 gene revealed that they belonged to two genogroups, IV and V. Of note, the As1/VN/QT03/2007 strain of genogroup V, isolated in 2007, was very closely related to the pandemic Asia 1 strain which caused FMD outbreaks in China (Asia1/WHN/CHA/06, FJ906802) and Mongolia (Asia1/MOG/05, EF614458) in 2005, sharing 99.0-99.3% nt and 99.5-100% aa identity. In contrast, the second strain As1/VN/LC04/2005 of genogroup IV, isolated in 2005, was closely related to all referenced Vietnamese serotype Asia 1 strains found in the GenBank databases, sharing 86.4-100% nt and 90.9-100% aa identity with each. This study is the first description of the full-length genomic sequence of Vietnamese FMDV serotypes O and Asia 1 and may provide the evidence of the concurrent circulation of different serotypes and subtypes of FMDV in recent years in Vietnam."

The HPAI viruses may originate because of the insertion of multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site of the hemagglutinin protein after the low-pathogenic H5 and H7 viruses have been introduced into poultry. In the present study, we investigated the phylogenetic characteristics of the H5 (n = 4) and H7 (n = 3) low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses isolated from wild birds in Korea by using nucleotide sequences of all 8 gene segments of the viral genome. Further, we evaluated the infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenic potential of these viruses in chickens. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all viruses used in the study clustered in the Eurasian lineage and were similar to the viruses isolated in Asian countries that share the East Asian-Australasian migratory bird flyway. Our H5N2 isolates could not be replicated and transmitted in chickens, but the H7N8 isolates could efficiently be replicated and transmitted to contact-exposure chickens. In addition, because our H7N8 isolates caused watery diarrhea in chickens, these viruses cannot only serve as progenitors of novel HPAI strains but also potentially cause clinical disease in poultry. Although there have been no reports of LPAI mutation to HPAI in these regions, the wild bird surveillance effort should focus on monitoring the introduction and transmission of the HPAI H5N1 and LPAI H5 and H7 viruses."

Thirteen and 1 isolates of NDV were categorized into lentogenic and velogenic viruses, respectively, based on in vivo pathogenicity tests. Twelve lentogenic viruses showed HA activity to horse RBCs, while 1 lentogenic virus and the velogenic virus were negative. Lentogenic viruses (n=13) had sequence motifs of (112)ERQERL(117) (n=1) or (112)GRQGRL(117) (n=12) at the F0 cleavage site, while the velogenic virus (n=1) had a sequence motif of (112)RRQKRF(117) at the same site. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that at least three distinct genotypes may exist in domestic ducks in Korea; one class I genotype (genotype 2), and two class II (genotypes I and VII) genotypes. The class I virus was most closely related to strains of genotype 2 which were isolated in birds from the USA, Germany and Denmark. Twelve lentogenic class II viruses were grouped together in genotype I, and were then divided into at least three clusters, namely Aomori-like, Ulster2C-like, and V4-like. The velogenic class II virus was assigned to genotype VII which represents viruses responsible for recent epidemics in many Asian countries including Korea.

The nucleotide composition of the genome is 73% A+T, but the ITRs are only 63% A+T. The genome contains 151 tightly packed open reading frames (ORFs) that either are > or =180 nucleotides in length or are conserved in other poxviruses. ORFs within 23 kb of each end are transcribed toward the termini, whereas ORFs within the central region of the genome are encoded on either DNA strand. In the central region ORFs have a conserved position, orientation, and sequence compared with vaccinia virus ORFs and encode many enzymes, transcription factors, or structural proteins. In contrast, ORFs near the termini are more divergent and in seven cases are without counterparts in other poxviruses. The YLDV genome encodes several predicted immunomodulators; examples include two proteins with similarity to CC chemokine receptors and predicted secreted proteins with similarity to MHC class I antigen, OX-2, interleukin-10/mda-7, poxvirus growth factor, serpins, and a type I interferon-binding protein. Phylogenic analyses indicated that YLDV is very closely related to yaba monkey tumor virus, but outside the yatapoxvirus genus YLDV is more closely related to swinepox virus and leporipoxviruses than to other chordopoxvirus genera."

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that chicken adapted H9N2 viruses (A/chicken/Korea/96006/96 [CK/Kor/96006-like]) have acquired aquatic avian gene segments through reassortment, and these reassorted H9N2 viruses were more frequently detected from minor poultry species than from industrial poultry. Conversely, gene segments from CK/Kor/96006-like viruses were also detected in most of the viruses from domestic ducks. Interestingly, domestic ducks, rather than wild aquatic birds, harbored close relatives of all eight gene segments of H3N2 CIV, which preferred binding to avian receptors. Therefore, bidirectional virus transmission events are assumed to have occurred between land-based poultry and aquatic poultry, in particular within the non-industrial poultry system. These events have contributed to the generation of a novel reassortant, H3N2 CIV. To prevent generating other reassortants capable of interspecies transmission, gene movements in the non-industrial poultry systems should be clarified and managed."

To date, only one complete genomic sequence of ILTV has been reported. This sequence was generated by concatenating partial sequences from six different ILTV strains. Thus, the full genomic sequence of a single (individual) strain of ILTV has not been determined previously. This study aimed to use high throughput sequencing technology to determine the complete genomic sequence of a live attenuated vaccine strain of ILTV. The complete genomic sequence of the Serva vaccine strain of ILTV was determined, annotated and compared to the concatenated ILTV reference sequence. The genome size of the Serva strain was 152,628 bp, with a G + C content of 48%. A total of 80 predicted open reading frames were identified. The Serva strain had 96.5% DNA sequence identity with the concatenated ILTV sequence. Notably, the concatenated ILTV sequence was found to lack four large regions of sequence, including 528 bp and 594 bp of sequence in the UL29 and UL36 genes, respectively, and two copies of a 1,563 bp sequence in the repeat regions. Considerable differences in the size of the predicted translation products of 4 other genes (UL54, UL30, UL37 and UL38) were also identified. More than 530 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. Most SNPs were located within three genomic regions, corresponding to sequence from the SA-2 ILTV vaccine strain in the concatenated ILTV sequence. This is the first complete genomic sequence of an individual ILTV strain. This sequence will facilitate future comparative genomic studies of ILTV by providing an appropriate reference sequence for the sequence analysis of other ILTV strains."

While recent studies demonstrated the importance of the nonstructural protein NSs as a major component of virulence in vertebrates, little is known about infection of mosquito vectors. Here we studied RVFV infection in three different mosquito cell lines, Aag2 cells from
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Aedes aegypti</jats:named-content>
            and U4.4 and C6/36 cells from
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Aedes albopictus</jats:named-content>
            . In contrast with mammalian cells, where NSs forms nuclear filaments, U4.4 and Aag2 cells downregulated NSs expression such that NSs filaments were never formed in nuclei of U4.4 cells and disappeared at an early time postinfection in the case of Aag2 cells. On the contrary, in C6/36 cells, NSs nuclear filaments were visible during the entire time course of infection. Analysis of virus-derived small interfering RNAs (viRNAs) by deep sequencing indicated that production of viRNAs was very low in C6/36 cells, which are known to be Dicer-2 deficient but expressed some viRNAs presenting a Piwi signature. In contrast, Aag2 and U4.4 cells produced large amounts of viRNAs predominantly matching the S segment and displaying Dicer-2 and Piwi signatures. Whereas 21-nucleotide (nt) Dicer-2 viRNAs were prominent during early infection, the population of 24- to 27-nt Piwi RNAs (piRNAs) increased progressively and became predominant later during the acute infection and during persistence. In Aag2 and U4.4 cells, the combined actions of the Dicer-2 and Piwi pathways triggered an efficient antiviral response permitting, among other actions, suppression of NSs filament formation and allowing establishment of persistence. In C6/36 cells, Piwi-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) appeared to be sufficient to mount an antiviral response against a secondary infection with a superinfecting virus. This study provides new insights into the role of Dicer and Piwi in mosquito antiviral defense and the development of the antiviral response in mosquitoes.

They infect susceptible bacterial hosts into which they either multiply or persist. In the latter case, phages can confer new functions to their hosts as a result of gene transfer, thus contributing to their adaptation (short-term) and evolution (long-term). In this regard, the role of phages on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among bacterial hosts in natural environments has not yet been clearly resolved. Here, we carry out a comprehensive analysis of thirty-three viromes from different habitats to investigate whether phages harbor ARGs. Our results demonstrate that while human-associated viromes do not or rarely carry ARGs, viromes from non-human sources (e.g. pig feces, raw sewage, and freshwater and marine environments) contain a large reservoir of ARGs, thus pointing out that phages could play a part on the spread of antibiotic resistance. Given this, the role of phages should not be underestimated and it should be considered when designing strategies to tackle the global crisis of antibiotic resistance."

While there is antigenic cross-reactivity among the other major viral structural proteins, the major glycoprotein, G, of BRS virus and that of HRS virus are antigenically distinct. The G glycoprotein has been implicated as the attachment protein for HRS virus. We have carried out a molecular comparison of the glycoprotein G of BRS virus with the HRS virus counterparts. cDNA clones corresponding to the BRS virus G glycoprotein mRNA were isolated and analyzed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The BRS virus G mRNA contained 838 nucleotides exclusive of poly(A) and had a major open reading frame coding for a polypeptide of 257 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of the BRS virus G polypeptide showed only 29 to 30% amino acid identity with the G protein of either the subgroup A or B HRS virus. However, despite this low level of identity, there were strong similarities in the predicted hydropathy profiles of the BRS virus and HRS virus G proteins. A cDNA molecule containing the complete BRS virus G major open reading frame was inserted into the thymidine kinase gene of vaccinia virus by homologous recombination, and a recombinant virus containing the BRS virus G protein gene was isolated. This recombinant virus expressed the BRS virus G protein, as demonstrated by Western immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence of infected cells. The BRS virus G protein expressed from the recombinant vector was transported to and expressed on the surface of infected cells. Antisera to the BRS virus G protein made by using the recombinant vector to immunize animals recognized the BRS virus attachment protein but not the HRS virus G protein and vice versa, confirming the lack of antigenic cross-reactivity between the BRS and HRS virus attachment proteins. On the basis of the data presented here, we conclude that BRS virus should be classified within the genus Pneumovirus in a group separate from HRS virus and that it is no more closely related to HRS virus subgroup A than it is to HRS virus subgroup B.</jats:p>"

The FAM and VIC-labeled probe sequences differed by three nucleotides, allowing the differentiation between genotype I and II. The assay detectability of genotype I and II real-time PCR assay was 1000 and 100 copies, respectively. Highly reproducible data were obtained as the coefficients of variation of threshold cycle values in inter-runs were less than 2.2%. The correct classification of genotype I and II viruses was assessed by using reference strains and characterized field isolates of both genotypes. The application to clinical diagnosis was evaluated on pooled blood samples by post run measurement of the FAM- and VIC-associated fluorescence.

Three flyways, the Central Asian, East Africa-West Asia, and Mediterranean/Black Sea flyways, converge in the Caucasus region. Thus, the Caucasus region might act as a migratory bridge for influenza virus transmission when birds aggregate in high concentrations in the post-breeding, migrating and overwintering periods. Since August 2009, we have established a surveillance network for influenza viruses in wild birds, using five sample areas geographically spread throughout suitable habitats in both eastern and western Georgia. We took paired tracheal and cloacal swabs and fresh feces samples. We collected 8343 swabs from 76 species belonging to 17 families in 11 orders of birds, of which 84 were real-time RT-PCR positive for avian influenza virus (AIV). No highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) H5 or H7 viruses were detected. The overall AIV prevalence was 1.6%. We observed peak prevalence in large gulls during the autumn migration (5.3-9.8%), but peak prevalence in Black-headed Gulls in spring (4.2-13%). In ducks, we observed increased AIV prevalence during the autumn post-moult aggregations and migration stop-over period (6.3%) but at lower levels to those observed in other more northerly post-moult areas in Eurasia. We observed another prevalence peak in the overwintering period (0.14-5.9%). Serological and virological monitoring of a breeding colony of Armenian Gulls showed that adult birds were seropositive on arrival at the breeding colony, but juveniles remained serologically and virologically negative for AIV throughout their time on the breeding grounds, in contrast to gull AIV data from other geographic regions. We show that close phylogenetic relatives of viruses isolated in Georgia are sourced from a wide geographic area throughout Western and Central Eurasia, and from areas that are represented by multiple different flyways, likely linking different host sub-populations."

To examine the evolutionary forces that have influenced the population dynamics of foot-and-mouth disease virus, individual genes and the coding genomes for the Eurasian (Asia1, A, C, and O) serotypes were examined for phylogenetic relationships, recombination, genetic diversity and selection. Our analyses demonstrate that paraphyletic relationships among serotypes are not as prevalent as previously proposed and suggest that convergent evolution might be obscuring phylogenetic relationships. We provide evidence that identification of recombinant sequences and recombination breakpoint patterns among and within serotypes are heavily dependent on the level of genetic diversity and convergent characters present in a particular data set as well as the methods used to detect recombination. Here, we also investigate the impact of adaptive positive selection on the capsid proteins and the non-structural genes 2B, 2C, 3A, and 3Cpro to identify genome regions involved in genetic diversity and antigenic variation. Two different categories of positive selection at the amino acid level were examined; conservative (stabilizing) selection that maintains particular phenotypic properties of an amino acid residue and radical (destabilizing), and selection that dramatically alters the phenotype and potentially the functional and/or structural features of the protein. Approximately, 29% of residues in the capsid proteins were under positive selection. Of those, 64% were under the influence of destabilizing selection, 80% were under the influence of stabilizing selection, and 44% had phenotypic properties influenced by both selection types. The majority of residues under selection (74%) were located outside of known antigenic sites; suggestive of additional uncharacterized epitopes and genomic regions involved in antigenic drift."

Since the unveiling of the 2009 H1N1 influenza, great deal of interest has been drawn to influenza, consequently a large number of influenza virus sequences have been deposited into the public sequence databases. Blast analysis demonstrated that the recently submitted 2007 South Dakota avian influenza virus strains and other North American avian strains contained genetic segments very closely related to the 2009 H1N1 virus, which suggests these avian influenza viruses are very close relatives of the 2009 H1N1 virus. Phylogenetic analyses also indicate that the 2009 H1N1 viruses are associated with both avian and swine influenza viruses circulating in North America. Since the migrating wild birds are preferable to pigs as the carrier to spread the influenza viruses across vast distances, it is very likely that birds played an important role in the inter-continental evolution of the 2009 H1N1 virus. It is essential to understand the evolutionary route of the emerging influenza virus in order to find a way to prevent further emerging cases. This study suggests the close relationship between 2009 pandemic virus and the North America avian viruses and underscores enhanced surveillance of influenza in birds for understanding the evolution of the 2009 pandemic influenza."

Herein, the possible origin, genotypes, and evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 based on available genomic sequences are determined. The closest ancestor of PCV3 is found to be within the clade 1 bat CVs. Using different phylogenetic methods, two major genotypes are identified, PCV3a and PCV3b. It is found that the effective population size of PCV3 increased rapidly during late 2013 to early 2014 and this is associated with the diversification of PCV3a and PCV3b. A relatively high effective reproductive number (Re) value and higher evolutionary rate were found compared to other singleâstranded DNA viruses, and positive selection on codons 122 and 320 (24 of ORF2) is identified. It is hypothesized that this, together with the prediction of a potential change of an antigenic epitope at position 320, might have allowed PCV3 to escape from the host immune response. Overall, this study has important implications for understanding the ongoing PCV3 cases worldwide and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures.</jats:p>"

The UL24 overlapped with TK by 64 nucleotides (nt), in a head-to-head transcription orientation, and the TK and gH had the same transcription orientation. The comparison of amino acid sequences of these 3 deduced DEV proteins with other 12 alphaherpesviruses displayed 5 highly conserved sites in the UL24, as well as another 5 consensus regions in the TK and 4 consensus regions in the gH. The RNA polymerase II transcriptional control elements were identified in all the UL24, TK and gH of DEV. These elements included core promoters, TATA motifs and polyadenylation sites. Phylogenetic analysis for the genetic classification of DEV in the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily with other 12 alphaherpesviruses was computed. The result showed that DEV was more closely related to avian herpesviruses, except infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), than to other alphaherpesviruses.

Using Illumina sequencing, histological examination, and quantitative real-time PCR, it was found that H9N2 AIV caused intestinal microbiota disorder, injury, and inflammatory damage to the intestinal mucosa. Notably, the genera Escherichia, especially E. coli, significantly increased (p &lt; 0.01) at five days post-infection (dpi), while Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and other probiotic organisms were significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.01). Simultaneously, the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, claudin 3, and occludin), TFF2, and Muc2 were significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.01), indicating the destruction of the intestinal epithelial cell tight junctions and the damage of mucin layer construction. Moreover, the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines IFN-Î³, IL-22, IFN-Î±, and IL-17A in intestinal epithelial cells were significantly upregulated, resulting in the inflammatory response and intestinal injury.

Cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be important modulators of the intricate virus-host interactions. In order to elucidate the role of miRNAs in madin-darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells during CPIV3 infection. In this study, we performed high-throughput sequencing technology to analyze small RNA libraries in CPIV3-infected and mock-infected MDBK cells. The results showed that a total of 249 known and 152 novel candidate miRNAs were differentially expressed in MDBK cells after CPIV3 infection, and 22,981 and 22,572 target genes were predicted, respectively. In addition, RT-qPCR assay was used to further confirm the expression patterns of 13 of these differentially expressed miRNAs and their mRNA targets. Functional annotation analysis showed these up- and downregulated target genes were mainly involved in MAPK signaling pathway, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway, focal adhesion, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, and apoptosis, et al. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the comparative expression of miRNAs in MDBK cells after CPIV3 infection. Our finding provides information concerning miRNAs expression profile in response to CPIV3 infection, and offers clues for identifying potential candidates for antiviral therapies against CPIV3."

We obtained two independent virus isolates named FS and JM from the diseased layer duck flocks and identified them as duck-origin Tembusu virus by PCR detection, sequencing the entire length of the open reading frames (ORFs). The two isolates FS and JM shared high sequence similarity to the isolates of duck-origin Tembusu virus that was first emerged in eastern China in April 2010. Blast analysis shows that the whole ORF sequences of FS and JM have the highest similarity (>99 %) to BYD-1(the first reported duck-origin Tembusu virus) and JS804 (the first reported goose-origin Tembusu virus), indicating that the full-length genomes were highly conserved in waterfowl-origin Tembusu viruses. The present study suggests that duck-origin Tembusu viruses have spread fast from eastern China to southern China, causing widely spreading infections. The high conservation of duck-origin Tembusu virus strains provides the genomic basis for choosing the strains for vaccine preparation for better protection against this new virus infection."

Using viral metagenomics, we identified circovirus-like DNA sequences and characterized 15 circular viral DNA genomes in stool samples from humans in Pakistan, Nigeria, Tunisia, and the United States and from wild chimpanzees. Distinct genomic features and phylogenetic analysis indicate that some viral genomes were part of a previously unrecognized genus in the Circoviridae family we tentatively named ""Cyclovirus"" whose genetic diversity is comparable to that of all the known species in the Circovirus genus. Circoviridae detection in the stools of U.S. adults was limited to porcine circoviruses which were also found in most U.S. pork products. To determine whether the divergent cycloviruses found in non-U.S. human stools were of dietary origin, we genetically compared them to the cycloviruses in muscle tissue samples of commonly eaten farm animals in Pakistan and Nigeria. Limited genetic overlap between cycloviruses in human stool samples and local cow, goat, sheep, camel, and chicken meat samples indicated that the majority of the 25 Cyclovirus species identified might be human viruses. We show that the genetic diversity of small circular DNA viral genomes in various mammals, including humans, is significantly larger than previously recognized, and frequent exposure through meat consumption and contact with animal or human feces provides ample opportunities for cyclovirus transmission. Determining the role of cycloviruses, found in 7 to 17% of non-U.S. human stools and 3 to 55% of non-U.S. meat samples tested, in both human and animal diseases is now facilitated by knowledge of their genomes."

            Bats are hosts to a variety of viruses capable of zoonotic transmissions. Because of increased contact between bats, humans, and other animal species, the possibility exists for further cross-species transmissions and ensuing disease outbreaks. We describe here full and partial viral genomes identified using metagenomics in the guano of bats from California and Texas. A total of 34% and 58% of 390,000 sequence reads from bat guano in California and Texas, respectively, were related to eukaryotic viruses, and the largest proportion of those infect insects, reflecting the diet of these insectivorous bats, including members of the viral families

Phylogenetic analysis was used to clarify the relationship to known viral taxa of novel sequences detected in bat guano samples, showing that some guano viral sequences fall outside existing taxonomic groups. This initial characterization of the bat guano virome, the first metagenomic analysis of viruses in wild mammals using second-generation sequencing, therefore showed the presence of previously unidentified viral species, genera, and possibly families. Viral metagenomics is a useful tool for genetically characterizing viruses present in animals with the known capability of direct or indirect viral zoonosis to humans.

Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene sequences of the isolated 27 strains together with 29 strains published in Genbank revealed that all IBV strains except for one isolated and one published were clustered into six distinct genotypes I-VI. 26 isolated strains belong to genotypes I, II, and III, forming a big phylogenetic branch without new predominant strains, whereas all five vaccine strains belong to genotype V that is evolutionarily distant from genotypes I, II, and III. The study of the protease cleavage motif within the S1 protein found 12 different cleavage motifs, of which 3 motifs are shared by both isolated and published strains, 2 motifs unique to isolated strains, and 7 motifs unique to published strains, further bolstering the notion of no new predominant strains. Alignment analysis of the S1 amino acid sequences indicated that the amino acid substitutions, insertions, and deletions are polymorphic and diverse, showing no sign of predominant genetic changes among the isolated strains. Taken together, there was no predominant new strain circulating in South China during 2004-2008. Nonetheless, circulating IBV strains have been continuously evolving with genetic compositions distant from vaccine strains; this explains why there have been constant but infrequent outbreaks in commercial flocks in South China during 2004-2008. Furthermore, in order to safe guard against the sudden emergence of new predominant strains, continuing surveillance of IBV strains circulating in the field is of extreme importance."

For assaying intracellular enzymes of interest (e.g. when Escherichia coli is used), it requires cell lysis in many cases, chemical or enzymatic, which can be tedious and cost-consuming. In this study, a set of UV-inducible autolytic vectors was constructed to offer a simpler means of cell lysis that is free of additional liquid handling. The SRRz lysis gene cassette from bacteriophage Lambda was cloned downstream of a UV-inducible promoter, the recA promoter or the umuDC promoter, and further inserted into the backbone of pUC18, and transformed into E. coli BL21 cells. The SRRz expression and cell lysis was induced by UV irradiation. For both the recA and umuDC promoters, at 30 degrees C the lysis efficiency was found to be consistent and above 60% as measured using beta-galactosidase as the reporter. However, at 37 degrees C the lysis profiles were found to be erratic. UV lysis in 96-well plates also produced consistent lysis results that were comparable to those obtained by lysozyme treatment, demonstrating the utility of these autolytic vectors in high throughput screening. This set of artificial SRRz autolysis units should be transferable to other vectors. Surprisingly, it was found that the E. coli BL21(DE3) was also partially disrupted under UV irradiation, with a lysis efficiency of 44.5% at 30 degrees C, and 22.5% at 37 degrees C."

Genome comparison of the SWH/CA/2004 isolate (GenBank Accession: DQ127910) with other known CSFV isolates was performed and analyzed. Corresponding segments from SWH/CA/2004 and other reported strains shared 80.4-99.8% identity at the nucleotide level and 89.5-99.8% identity at the amino acid level. From an evolutionary point of view, isolate SWH/CA/2004 is closely related to the highly virulent isolate cF114/CA/2001, with a pairwise distance of 0.013; and distantly related to the moderately virulent isolate GXWZ02/CA/2003, with pairwise distance 0.170. The phylogenetic trees of the full-length genome and the following region E(rns), E1, E2, and NS5B-based neighbor-joining (NJ) method were constructed and approximately divided into different genetic groups according to avirulence, moderate virulence and high virulence, while other region-based NJ trees demonstrated sequence conservation between these groups. The four genomic regions may constitute important criteria for genetic typing of diverse CSFV isolates. Based on these analyses, isolate SWH/CA/2004 was deduced to belong to the highly virulent isolate group. However, SWH/CA/2004 also contains a 14-U deletion in the 3'-NTR that is characteristic of avirulent isolates. These analyses constitute a comprehensive study of the phylogenetics of CSF based on distinct regions of the genome and may provide the basis for future molecular epidemiology research to identify virulent strain outbreaks and trigger implementation of appropriate control measures."

There was differential miRNA expression between the uninfected and infected cells: 65 miRNAs were upregulated and 128 miRNAs were downregulated.

Gene Ontology analysis and KEGG function annotations of the host target genes suggested that the miRNAs are involved in complex cellular pathways, including cellular metabolic processes, immune system processes, and gene expression. These data suggest that a large group of miRNAs is expressed in PK-15 cells and that some miRNAs were altered in PPV-infected PK-15 cells. A number of microRNAs play an important role in regulating immune-related gene expression.

The results indicated that their genome composition differed significantly and shared only 88.5% nucleotide identity with each other. The genetic variation and amino acid substitutions were not randomly distributed in the genome, and mainly focused on ORF1a, ORF3 and ORF5. The SY0608 strain, with high pathogenicity, had a 30-amino-acid deletion at amino acid positions 480 and 532-560 in comparison with the S1 strain. The alignment of amino acid sequence of Nsp1-Nsp8, GP2-GP5, M and N of S1 and SY0608 with other PRRSV isolates demonstrated that variation was mainly found in the Nsp2, GP3 and GP5 proteins. In comparison with the S1 strain, the SY0608 strain showed some potential glycosylation site mutations in GP5 at amino acid positions between 26 and 39, which might be associated with viral antigenicity.

Data show that the Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) of GETV existed about 145years ago (95% HPD: 75-244) and gradually evolved into four distinct evolutionary populations: Groups I-IV. The MRCA of GETVs in Group III, which includes all GETVs isolated from mosquitoes, pigs, horses, and other animals since the 1960s (from latitude 19Â°N to 60Â°N), existed about 51years ago (95% HPD: 51-72). Group III is responsible for most viral epidemics among domestic animals. An analysis of the GETV E2 protein sequence and structure revealed seven common amino acid mutation sites. These sites are responsible for the structural and electrostatic differences detected between widespread Group III isolates and the prototype strain MM2021. These differences may account for the recent geographical radiation of the virus. Considering the economic significance of GETV infection in pigs and horses, we recommend the implementation of strict viral screening and monitoring programs."

Here, we investigated the transcriptome profiles and miRNA expression profiles of ALV-J-infected and uninfected chicken spleens to identify the genes and miRNAs related to ALV-J invasion. In total, 252 genes and 167 miRNAs were differentially expressed in ALV-J-infected spleens compared to control uninfected spleens. miR-23b expression was up-regulated in ALV-J-infected spleens compared with the control spleens, and transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) was down-regulated in ALV-J-infected spleens compared to uninfected spleens. A dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that IRF1 was a direct target of miR-23b. miR-23b overexpression significantly (P = 0.0022) decreased IRF1 mRNA levels and repressed IRF1-3'-UTR reporter activity. In vitro experiments revealed that miR-23b overexpression strengthened ALV-J replication, whereas miR-23b loss of function inhibited ALV-J replication. IRF1 overexpression inhibited ALV-J replication, and IRF1 knockdown enhanced ALV-J replication. Moreover, IRF1 overexpression significantly (P = 0.0014) increased IFN-Î² expression. In conclusion, these results suggested that miR-23b may play an important role in ALV-J replication by targeting IRF1."

Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to analyse the microRNA expression in the spleen, thymus and bursa of Fabricius of H5N1-HPAIV-infected and non-infected chickens and ducks. We annotated the genomic positions of duck microRNAs and we compared the microRNA repertoires of chickens and ducks. Our results showed that the microRNA expression patterns in the homologous immune organs of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens and ducks diverge substantially. Moreover, there was larger divergence between the microRNA expression patterns in immune organs of HPAIV-infected chickens than HPAIV-infected ducks. Together, our results might help to elucidate the roles of microRNAs in the divergent immunity of chickens and ducks against H5N1 HPAIV."

This review systematically introduces the current status of the diversity and geographical distribution of arboviruses and vectors in China. In addition, our results provide strong technical support for the prevention and control of arboviral diseases, the treatment of epidemics, and the early warning and prediction of diseases, and so they are significant for the control and prevention of arboviral diseases in Asia and around the world."

All strains were determined to be velogenic by plaque formation, the mean death time (MDT) of embryonated eggs, and the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI). For preparation of virus RNA, the acid guanidinium-thiocyanate method was used. A 908bp fragment of nucleotide was amplified by RT-PCR starting from the N terminal of the F gene and the PCR segments were cloned into the PGEM-T vector and sequenced. The similarities of the nucleotide sequences (1-519bp) and predicted amino acid sequences of the F gene (1-125) were analyzed by comparing the 12 NDV isolates with the NDV vaccine strains Lasota, B1, H1 and V4, with classical NDV strains and recent epizootic strains. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that all strains were of two novel genotypes; the NDV strains that caused the outbreak of ND in western China during 1998-1999 was of the genotype VIIa, whereas the strains from the Qinghai province (1979-1985) were of genotype VIII, which has been found predominately in southern Africa."

The nucleotide sequences were compared with other previously characterized BLV variants from different geographical areas (Belgium, France, Italy, North America, Australia, Japan and Argentina). The majority of analyzed segments had a tendency for nucleotide substitution without changing the amino acid. The constructed phylogenetic tree showed the relations and differences between proviruses and within each one. Most of the samples in Argentina formed one cluster. The samples in Japan, except one, also formed one cluster and some of them showed high homology with the isolates from Australia and the USA.

Part of the amplified F protein DNA product (nucleotide sequence 47-418) and the deduced amino acid sequences were compared phylogenetically with those from strains previously reported in Taiwan and other geographic regions. Our results showed that all Taiwanese isolates (n=20) collected during 2003-2006, according to the phylogenetic tree, belong to the genotype VIId. In addition, all the six Taiwanese isolates obtained in 2003, carry the motif (112)R-R-Q-K-R(116) and have the amino acid L(23) replaced by F(23) (assigned as Group 1). On the other hand, 12 out of the 14 Taiwanese isolates obtained during 2004-2006 possess the motif (112)R-R-K-K-R(116) and have the amino acid G(74), instead of E(74) (assigned as Group 2). To our best knowledge, this is the first reported VIId isolates that possess the sequences of G(74)/(112)R-R-K-K-R(116) within the F0 protein. Since a high mortality, severe clinical signs, typical postmortem lesions, and a high intra-cerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) were observed in the NDV-infected chickens, these isolates acquired between 2003 and 2006 are considered as the velogenic type. The Group 2 viruses have become dominant and responsible for the majority of Taiwanese outbreaks during recent years. Based on our phylogenetic analysis, it can be postulated that these isolates were evolved from previously reported local strains, and the Group 2 family emerged the latest in the genotype VIId. The information is fundamental to improving the efficiency of controlling strategies and vaccine development for NDV."

The present study investigated the genetic and protectotypic features of newly emerged Korean IBV strains. A phylogenetic analysis showed that several recent isolates formed 2 different clusters (new cluster 1 and 2), which were distinct from other preexisting clusters. New cluster 1 IBV strains represented recombinants between Korean nephropathogenic strain KM91 and the QXIBV strain. New cluster 2 IBV strains showed low amino acid homology (<58.7%) compared with previous isolates. We evaluated the protective efficacy of commercial IBV vaccines (H120 and K2 strain) against these new isolates. In cross-protection studies, the H120 strain did not provide sufficient protection against these variants. However, highly attenuated nephropathogenic IBV vaccine, K2 strain, provided significantly higher levels of protection against variants compared with chickens vaccinated with H120 (P < 0.05 or better). These results indicate that the K2 vaccine could be helpful for the reduction of economic losses caused by newly evolving IBV recombinants (new cluster 1) and variants (new cluster 2)."

Zoonotic transmission may contribute to the high HEV seroprevalence in the human population of many countries. A novel divergent HEV from moose (Alces alces) in Sweden was recently identified by partial genome sequencing. Since only one strain was found, its classification within the HEV family, prevalence in moose and zoonotic potential was unclear. We therefore investigated samples from 231 moose in seven Swedish counties for HEV, and sequenced a near complete moose HEV genome. Phylogenetic analysis to classify this virus within the family Hepeviridae and to explore potential host specific determinants was performed. The HEV prevalence of moose was determined by PCR (marker for active infection) and serological assays (marker of past infection) of sera and 51 fecal samples from 231 Swedish moose. Markers of active and past infection were found in 67 (29%) animals, while 34 (15%) were positive for HEV RNA, 43 (19%) were seropositive for anti-HEV antibodies, and 10 (4%) had both markers. The number of young individuals positive for HEV RNA was larger than for older individuals, and the number of anti-HEV antibody positive individuals increased with age. The high throughput sequenced moose HEV genome was 35-60% identical to existing HEVs. Partial ORF1 sequences from 13 moose strains showed high similarity among them, forming a distinct monophyletic clade with a common ancestor to HEV genotype 1-6 group, which includes members known for zoonotic transmission. This study demonstrates a high frequency of HEV in moose in Sweden, with markers of current and past infection demonstrated in 30% of the animals. Moose is thus an important animal reservoir of HEV. The phylogenetic relationship demonstrated that the moose HEV belonged to the genotype 1-6 group, which includes strains that also infect humans, and therefore may signify a potential for zoonotic transmission of this HEV."

During 2009-2010, six strains of H3N2 influenza virus were isolated from dogs in Jiangsu Province, China. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of eight gene segments revealed that the six viruses were most similar to a recent canine-derived subtype H3N2 influenza virus isolated in cats from South Korea, which originated from avian strain. By comparing the deduced amino acid sequences of the hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the six Jiangsu isolates against the most similar avian strains, we found that all isolates had several common mutations at the receptor-binding sites, potential glycosylation sites and cleavage site in HA1, and antigenic sites in both the HA1 and NA segments. Significantly, a unique two amino acid insertion in the NA stalk was found. Experimental infection of BALB/c mice revealed that viral RNA could be detected in the major rodent organs, such as brain, heart, spleen, kidney, liver and intestine, as well as the lung. All the sampled organs from infected mice showed significant lesions and viral antigen staining. This study highlights the potential of domesticated animals to become a reservoir for influenza virus and the need for surveillance programs to detect cross-species transmission."

H7N9 cases were later detected in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. It was estimated that the virus first spread northward along the route taken by migratory birds and then spread to neighbouring provinces with the sale of poultry. Epidemiological studies were carried out on samples from the external environment of infected cases, transmission routes, farmers markets and live poultry markets. Phylogenetic study of viral sequences from human and avian infections in Zhejiang showed that those from Shanghai and Jiangsu provinces along Taihu Lake were highly homologous with those from the external environment. This suggests that avian viruses carried by waterfowl combined with the virus carried by migratory birds, giving rise to avian influenza virus H7N9, which is highly pathogenic to humans. It is possible that the virus was transmitted by local wildfowl to domestic poultry and then to humans, or spread further by means of trading in wholesale poultry markets. As the weather has turned warm, and with measures adopted to terminate poultry trade and facilitate health communication, the epidemic in the first half of the year has been kept under control. However, the infection source in the triangular area around Taihu Lake still remains. The H7N9 epidemic will probably hit the area later in the year and next spring when the migratory birds return and may even spread to other areas. Great importance should therefore be attached to the wildfowl in Taihu Lake as the repository and disseminator of the virus: investigation and study of this population is essential."

The re-emergence of Aujeszky's disease (AD) in pig farms vaccinated with live vaccine (Bartha-K61) caused substantial economic losses to Chinese pig industry since late 2011. A field ADV, named Qihe547, was isolated from pigs that exhibited suspected AD clinical symptoms. To better understand the genetic characteristics and mutations of Qihe547 ADV, the whole genome was sequenced and analyzed. The genomic length of Qihe547 ADV was 143,404Â bp, with 73.59% Gâ+âC contents. Phylogenetic analysis based on the whole genome of ADV strains revealed that Chinese ADV strains were located to one group with three subgroups. Qihe547 ADV was closely related to these novel ADV strains isolated in China since 2012. Qihe547 presented numerous hypervariable regions compared with oversea ADV strains. In 34 genes of Qihe547 ADV, amino acid (AA) insertion or deletion were observed. In addition, numerous AA mutations were found in the main protective antigen genes (gB, gC and gD genes). The differences of potential antigenic peptides in the main protective antigens between Qihe547 ADV and ADV Bartha were discovered in the dominant antigenic regions of gB (AA59-AA126, AA507-AA734),the extracellular region of gC and gD. High diversity was observed between Qihe547 and foreign ADV isolates. The AA variations and the differences of potential antigenic peptides in the important functional regions of the main protective antigen (gB, gC and gD) of ADV Qihe547 may contribute to immune evasion of the virus and may be partial reason that the virus escapes from the vaccination of Bartha-K61 vaccine.

Here, we characterized these viruses by performing sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of their viral genes, assessing their virulence in ducks and mice, and performing cross-protection experiments in chickens. Sequence analysis revealed that the HA genes of these H5N5 viruses showed 97.1-97.8% homology to A/wild duck/Hunan/211/2005 (H5N1) influenza virus and that their NA genes showed 96.4-96.8% nucleotide identity to the NA gene of A/duck/Hunan/5613/2003 (H6N5) influenza virus, which belongs to the Eurasian lineage. Genotypic analysis indicated that these H5N5 viruses were multiple reassortants among H5N1, H5N2, H6N2, and H6N5 viruses. The analysis of HA clade showed that these H5N5 viruses are clustering into clade 2.3.4. In animal experiments, these H5N5 viruses caused 50% mortality in ducks and 100% mortality in chickens. In cross-protection experiments, the clade 2.3.2 avian influenza vaccine could provide only 75% protection with chickens against H5N5 virus challenge. Moreover, the H5N5 virus replicated efficiently in the lungs of mice, which suggested that the H5N5 viruses have the potential to infect mammalian hosts. Since ducks have served as reassortant vessels, playing pivotal roles in the generation of new subtypes of influenza viruses, it is important to monitor the emergence of this novel subtype of influenza viruses in waterfowl to understand their ecology and evolution and to control the spread of new viruses."

Their pathogens are small ruminant morbillivirus (SRMV) and Echinococcus granulosus (E. granulosus), respectively. The SRMV, formerly called peste-des-petits-ruminants virus (PPRV), is classified into the genus Morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. This virus is an ideal vaccine vector to deliver immunogenic proteins. In this study, a reverse genetics system was developed to rescue a recombinant SRMV (Nigeria 75/1 strain) expressing E. granulosus EG95 antigen in vitro. The recombinant SRMV, albeit replicating more slowly than its parental virus, could effectively express the EG95 antigen in cells by analyses of Western blot, indirect immunofluorescence and mass spectrometry. An EG95 subunit vaccine has been widely used for prevention of cystic hydatidosis in some areas of China. The EG95-expressing SRMV, if proven to induce effective immune responses against both diseases in a future animal experiment, would become a potential candidate of bivalent vaccine."

If genetically modified using reverse genetics, the SRMV would be a useful vector to express foreign proteins in vitro and in vivo. In this study, a recombinant SRMV was rescued by reverse genetics for efficiently expressing an enhanced green ï¬uorescent protein (eGFP) in vitro. Based on green fluorescence-tracked characteristics of the recombinant SRMV, eight mammalian cell lines (BHK-21, F81, MDBK, RK13, MDCK, PK15, Vero and GT) were selected for identifying their susceptibilities to SRMV infection. The result showed that all cell lines could be infected with the recombinant SRMV but at different efficiencies. The Vero and PK15 cell lines showed the highest and lowest susceptibilities to its infection, respectively, if merely comparing the proportions of green fluorescence-emitting cells among eight cell monolayers."

To identify changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression and post-transcriptional regulatory responses to PRV infection in porcine kidney epithelial (PK15) cells, we sequenced a small RNA (sRNA) library prepared from infected PK15 cells and compared it to a library prepared from uninfected cells using Illumina deep sequencing. Here we found 25 novel viral miRNAs by high-throughput sequencing and 20 of these miRNAs were confirmed through stem-loop RT-qPCR. Intriguingly, unlike the usual miRNAs encoded by the Î±-herpesviruses, which are found clustered in the large latency transcript (LLT), these novel viral miRNAs are throughout the PRV genome like Î²-herpesviruses. Viral miRNAs are predicted to target multiple genes and form a complex regulatory network. GO analysis on host targets of viral miRNAs were involved in complex cellular processes, including the metabolic pathway, biological regulation, stimulus response, signaling process and immune response. Moreover, 13 host miRNAs were expressed with significant difference after infection with PRV: 8 miRNAs were up-regulated and 5 miRNAs were down-regulated, which may affect viral replication in host cell. Our results provided new insight into the characteristic of miRNAs in response to PRV infection, which is significant for further study of these miRNAs function."

It was 7691 nucleotides long and had 5'- and 3'-terminal non-coding regions of 626 and 315 nucleotides, respectively. The poly(A) tail contained at least 22 residues and the single open reading frame encoded a polypeptide of 2249 amino acids. The VP1 gene was also sequenced from nine southeast China field isolates and three attenuated DHV-I vaccine strains. In phylogenetic analysis of the isolates and other published sequences, attenuated and tissue-adapted isolates (including ZJ-V) clustered as genotypes significantly different from the field isolates that had not been passaged in chicken/duck embryos. There were two consistent amino acid substitutions (E(129)-->V(129) and A(142)-->S(142)) between all the field isolates and all the tissue-adapted ones. The carboxyl terminal region was generally the most variable and here the four attenuated Chinese isolates showed six consistent differences from the field isolates (S(181)-->L(181), H(183)K(184)-->R(183)G(1841), N(193)-->D(193), E(205)-->K(205), R(217)-->K(217), N(235)-->D(235)). It seems likely that at least some of these differences result from mutations leading to isolate attenuation."

Compared with the full genome sequences of Class II NDV strains, the NDV08-004 isolate has a 12-nt insertion (TGGGAGACGGGG) in the phosphoprotein gene between nucleotides 2381 and 2382 of the genome (numbered according to the genomic sequence of the La Sota strain, which consists of 15186 nt). Strain NDV08-004 has the motif (112)E-Q-Q-E-R-L(117) at the cleavage site of the fusion protein, which is typical of lentogenic NDV strains, and this is in agreement with the results of pathogenic tests based on the mean death time (MDT) and the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI). Phylogenetic analysis based on the full genome revealed that all the NDV strains studied could be divided into two distinct clades, namely class I and class II, and the NDV08-004 isolate characterized in this study was grouped in class I.

Nucleotide sequences of six isolates showed more than 99% pairwise identity rates, and the sequences of isolates from pig and boar in the same region were completely identical with each other, without any genetic deletion or insertion. From comparative analysis of variability of each EMCV protein coding region, 3D and VP3 regions showed that the highest average identity rates, and was confirmed as highly conserved. In contrast, the protein coding regions 3A and 3B was confirmed to be highly variable region with the lowest average identity rate.

The mean death time and intracerebral pathogenicity index were used to evaluate the virulence of the isolates. Pathogenicity tests showed that all 10 isolates were velogenic strains. The main functional region of the F gene made up of 535 nucleotides was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of the fusion protein cleavage site in all 10 isolates was 112RRQKRF117, which is a typical sequence of velogenic strains and is in agreement with the results of in vivo pathogenicity tests. For genotyping, a phylogenetic tree based on nucleotides 47-435 of the F gene was constructed. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the isolates were of the genotype VII virus. Only one strain, WG, was found to be of the genotype IX virus. This strain was closest to F48E9, which was isolated in China in 1946 and has been used as a standard challenge strain in vaccine evaluation in China. So, genotype IX virus still causes sporadic infections in geese in China. Further phylogenetic analyses on the genotype VII strains found that all these strains can be subdivided into 5 subgenotypes, and most of the isolates (8 strains) were classified as VIId, a predominant genotype responsible for most Newcastle disease (ND) outbreaks since the end of the past century in China. Only 1 strain, NDV03-053, was shown to be of genotype VIIc virus. Results indicate that the strains of genotype VIId NDV have been the major pathogen, responsible for most epizootic ND outbreaks in waterfowl in China since 1997."

To assess the evolutionary characteristics of H2 influenza viruses isolated from migratory ducks that congregate in Hokkaido, Japan, on their flyway of migration from Siberia in 2001, we investigated the phylogenetic relationships among these viruses and avian and human viruses described previously. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the PB2 gene of Dk/Hokkaido/107/01 (H2N3) and the PA gene of Dk/Hokkaido/95/01 (H2N2) belonged to the American lineage of avian virus and that the other genes of the isolates belonged to the Eurasian lineage. These results indicate that the internal protein genes might be transmitted from American to Eurasian avian host. Thus, it is further confirmed that interregional transmission of influenza viruses occurred between the North American and Eurasian birds. The fact that reassortants could be generated in the migratory ducks between North American and Eurasian avian virus lineage further stresses the importance of global surveillance among the migratory ducks."

In the present study, a novel variant of PRRSV strain named FJLIUY-2017 was isolated from abortion rate (25%) in pregnant gilts in Fujian Province in China in 2017. To further our knowledge about the novel virus strain, we characterized the complete genome of FJLIUY-2017. Comparison to PRRS sequences in GenBank confirmed the absence of close relatives (<92%), but indicated FJLIUY-2017 belonged to NADC30-like PRRSV. The full length of FJLIUY-2017 was determined to be 15017 nucleotides (nt), excluding the poly(A) tail, shared 86.2-86.6% identity with JXA1-like strains (JXA1, TJ and FJYR), 88.9-90.6% with NADC30-like PRRSVs (NADC30, FJZ03 and CHsx1401), 86.4-86.5% with VR2332-like (VR2332, RespPRRS MLV and BJ-4) and only 60.8% with LV (European type). Recombination analyses revealed genomic breakpoints in structural (ORF3, ORF4 and ORF7) and nonstructural (Nsp1, Nsp2, Nsp6, Nsp9, Nsp11 and Nsp12) regions of the genomes with evidence for recombination events between lineages 1, 3, 5.1 and 8.7.

Here, we genetically analyzed the HA and NA genes of five H9N2 viruses isolated from the migratory ducks in Hokkaido, Japan, the flyway of migration from Siberia during 1997-2000. The results showed that HA and NA genes of these viruses belong to the same lineages, respectively.

The NA genes of the five isolates were located in the same cluster as those of N2 viruses, which had caused a human pandemic in 1968, indicating that the NA genes of the previous pandemic strains are still circulating in waterfowl reservoirs.

Bayesian and maximum-likelihood analyses of genome sequences showed a close relationship of porcine bufaviruses to human and monkey bufaviruses. Molecular dating of the most recent common ancestors supported a recent introduction of bufaviruses into human and pig populations, respectively.

However, the isolate had virulence in pigeons, resulting in severe nervous signs and highly mortality.

To determine the overall molecular epidemiology of hepatitis E virus (HEV) and analyze the situation of cross-species transmission between humans and swine in China over the last 25 years (1986-2011), 626 HEV complete and partial sequences (89 isolates identified by our group) isolated from humans and animals in China were retrieved from GenBank and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. There were three genotypes and 11 sub-genotypes of HEV prevailing in China. Furthermore, rabbit HEVs, of which the genotype is controversial, are also widespread in China. Genotype 1 was the most isolated genotype prior to 2000 and mainly detected in Xinjiang, Beijing and East China. However, genotype 4, which was identified in most regions of China during the last 10 years, has overtaken genotype 1 in frequency of isolation nationwide. Genotype 3 HEV strains have been found only in eastern China and were thought to be imported from Japan. Both genotypes 3 and 4 were found in humans and swine and cross-species transmission from pigs to humans of the two genotypes may have occurred in Northeast, Northwest, North, East and South China. These results indicate that HEV strains with considerable genetic diversity are widespread and the zoonotic transmission between swine and humans appears ubiquitous in China."

In the present study, a survey of avian influenza virus in tree sparrows was performed and a HPAI H5N1 virus (A/tree sparrow/Jiangsu/1/08) was isolated. The H5N1 virus was found to be a genotype V variant belonging to clade 2.3.4, which had newly emerged in southern China in 2005. Genetic analysis showed that it had a close relation with A/Jiangsu/1/07 (H5N1), which was thought to be responsible for a probable limited person-to-person transmission in a family cluster in China in 2007. Pathogencity studies showed that the virus was highly virulent when experimentally inoculated into the chickens, tree sparrow, and mouse. As clade 2.3.4, genotype V variant of H5N1 virus has been accounted for the most of human fatal cases in China during 2005-2008, the existence of such H5N1 variants in the tree sparrows highlights the potential threat of this type of wild bird infection to veterinary and public health."

SFTS virus (SFTSV) has been identified as the causative agent of the disease and has been recognized as a public health threat. This novel Bunyavirus belongs to the Phlebovirus genus in the family Bunyaviridae. This review also describes the different aspects of virology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical symptoms on the basis of the published article surveillance data and phylogenetic analyses of viral sequences of large, medium, and small segments retrieved from database using mega 5.05, simplot 3.5.1, network 4.611, and epi information system 3.5.3 software. SFTS presents with fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and considerable changes in several serum biomarkers. The disease has 10~15% mortality rate, commonly because of multiorgan dysfunction. SFTSV is mainly reported in the rural areas of Central and North-Eastern China, with seasonal occurrence from May to September, mainly targeting those of â¥50âyears of age. A wide range of domesticated animals, including sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, dogs, and chickens have been proven seropositive for SFTSV. Ticks, especially Haemaphysalis longicornis, are suspected to be the potential vector, which have a broad animal host range in the world. More studies are needed to elucidate the vector-animal-human ecological cycle, the pathogenic mechanisms in high level animal models and vaccine development."

All these strains have the same S-3-M-5-N gene order, as is the case for other IBVs. However, the sizes of the corresponding open reading frames (ORFs) of some genes varied among the virus strains. Phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignments demonstrated that recombination events had occurred in the origin and evolution of the strains CK/CH/LSD/03I and CK/CH/LLN/98I and the possible recombinant junction sites might be located at the 3c and M genes, respectively. The normal product of ORF 3a is 57 amino acids long, whereas a 43-bp deletion at the 3'-end of the CK/CH/LSD/03I 3a gene was detected, resulting in a frameshift event and C-terminally truncated protein with 47 amino acids. Comparison of the growth ability in embryos and replication and pathogenicity in chickens with IBV carrying the normal 3a gene indicated that this deleted sequence in the 3a gene of CK/CH/LSD/03I was not necessary for viral pathogenesis and replication either in vitro or in vivo. Occurrence of a mutation at the corresponding position of the CK/CH/LLN/98I start codon in the 3a gene led to the absence of ORF 3a in this virus, resulting in a novel genomic organization at the 3'-encoding regions: S-3b, 3c-M-5a, 5b-N. Comparison with other viruses carrying the normal 3a gene revealed that CK/CH/LLN/98I had replication and pathogenicity abilities in vivo similar to those of other IBVs; however, its growth ability in embryos was lower, although the relationship between the lower growth ability and the ORF 3a defect requires further confirmation."

Most of the previous studies related to the PED were focused on the pathology and etiology of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). A little was known regarding the status of gut microbiota after piglets infected by PEDV. In this study, aided by metagenome sequencing technology, gut microbiota profiles in feces of viral diarrhea (VD) and viral control (VC) piglets were investigated. The results showed that the abundance of four dominant phyla (Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Proteobacteria) in feces was affected greatly by porcine epidemic diarrhea. Especially, the abundance of Fusobacteria was higher in VD piglets (36%) than in VC piglets (5%). On the contrary, the Verrucomicrobia was detected in lower distribution proportion in VD piglets (around 0%) than in VC piglets (20%). Furthermore, 25 genera were significantly different between VC and VD piglets at the genus level. Among the 25 genera, Leptotrichia belonging to Fusobacteria was remarkably lower in VC piglets than in VD piglets. Akkermansia belonging to Verrucomicrobia was higher in VC piglets than in VD piglets. Our findings implicated that the gut microbiota associated with PED significantly provided an insight into the pathology and physiology of PED."

While inter-genotypic recombination of HBV is common, it has not been reported with DHBV. In this study, 32 non-redundant DHBV complete genomes were analyzed using phylogenetic methods and classified into two clusters, corresponding to the 'Chinese' and 'Western country' branches previously reported based on geographical distribution. One 'Chinese' branch strain was isolated in Australia and three 'Western country' branch strains were isolated in China, suggesting cross-geographical distribution of both branches. Recombination analyses of the 32 DHBV genomes identified two possible inter-genotypic recombination events with high confidence value. These recombination events occurred between the lineages represented, respectively, by the Chinese isolate GD3 (AY536371, 'Chinese' branch) and the American isolate DHBV16 (K01834, 'Western country' branch), giving rise to two Chinese recombinant isolates CH4 (EU429324) and CH6 (EU429326). The identification of inter-genotypic recombination among circulating DHBV isolates suggests the usefulness of DHBV as a model for studying the mechanism of HBV recombination."

This disease is most prevalent in the south, southeast and the east region of Asia. In this study, two JEV strains, named JEV/SW/GD/01/2009 and JEV/SW/GZ/09/2004, were isolated from aborted fetuses and seminal fluid of pigs in China. To determine the characteristic of these virus isolates, the virulence of two newly JEV isolates was investigated, the result evidenced that the JEV/SW/GD/01/2009 did not kill mice, while the JEV/SW/GZ/09/2004 displayed neurovirulence with 0.925log10 p.f.u./LD50. Additionally, the full genome sequences of JEV were determined and compared with other known JEV strains. Results demonstrated that the genome of two JEV isolates was 10,976 nucleotides (nt) in length. As compared to the Chinese vaccine strain SA14-14-2, the JEV/SW/GD/01/2009 and the JEV/SW/GZ/09/2004 showed 99.7% and 97.5% identity at the nucleotide level, 99.6% and 96.7% identity at the amino acid level, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis, based on the full-length genome revealed that two JEV isolates were all clustered into genotype III compared to the reference strains. Furthermore, selection analyses revealed that dominant selective pressure acting on the JEV genome was purifying selection. Four sites under positive selection were identified: codon 521 (amino acid E-227), 2296 (amino acid NS4b-24), 3048 (amino acid NS5-521) and 3055 (amino acid NS5-528). Amino acid E-227 was proved to be related to neurovirulence. Taken together, the molecular epidemiology and functional of positively selected amino acid sites of two newly JEV isolates were fully understood, which might be helpful to predict possible changes in virulence."

In this study, we obtained the miRNA expression profiles of PCMV-infected porcine macrophages via high-throughput sequencing. The comprehensive analysis of miRNA profiles showed that 239 miRNA database-annotated and 355 novel pig-encoded miRNAs were detected. Of these, 130 miRNAs showed significant differential expression between the PCMV-infected and uninfected porcine macrophages. The 10 differentially expressed pig-encoded miRNAs were further determined by stem-loop reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the results were consistent with the high-throughput sequencing. Gene Ontology analysis of the target genes of miRNAs in PCMV-infected porcine macrophages showed that the differentially expressed miRNAs are mainly involved in immune and metabolic processes. This is the first report of the miRNA transcriptome in porcine macrophages and an analysis of the miRNA regulatory mechanisms during PCMV infection. Further research into the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during immunosuppressive viral infections should contribute to the treatment and prevention of immunosuppressive viruses."

Although recent studies have shown that miRNAs play important roles in immune responses, the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during immunosuppressive virus infection remain unclear. In this study, porcine small-RNA transcriptomes of PCMV-infected and uninfected vital organs were first characterised by high-throughput sequencing. miRDeep2 software was used to predict novel pig-encoded miRNAs. To verify the accuracy of the high-throughput sequencing results, stem-loop qRT-PCR was performed on 12 significantly DE miRNAs. The physical and functional interactions between the immune-related target genes of the DE miRNAs in PCMV-infected organs were analysed using the STRING database. In total, 306 annotated and 295 novel miRNAs were identified from PCMV-infected and uninfected porcine organs, respectively, through alignment with known Sus scrofa pre-miRNAs. Overall, 92, 107, 95, 77 and 111 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in lung, liver, spleen, kidney and thymus after PCMV infection, respectively. According to Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs associated with immune system processes, regulation of biological processes and metabolic processes were enriched in every sample. Integrated expression analysis of the differentially expressed miRNAs and their target mRNAs in PCMV-infected thymus showed that the significant differential expression of specific miRNAs under the pressure of PCMV infection in central immune organs interfered with the expression of genes involved in important immune-related signalling pathways, thus promoting the viral infection. This is the first comprehensive analysis of the responses of host small-RNA transcriptomes to PCMV infection in vital porcine organs. It provides new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during infection by immunosuppressive viruses."

Pathogenicity experiments conducted in this study indicated that the virus was highly pathogenic for chickens but lowly pathogenic for mammalian hosts, as evidenced by reduced infection of mice. The analysis of complete genome sequences and genetic evolution showed that A/Swan/Shanghai/10/09 (SW/SH/09) may be derived from the strain A/silky chicken/Shantou/475/2004 (CK/ST/04), which is homologous to the influenza viruses isolated from chicken, duck, pika, little egret, swan, mandarin duck and bar-headed goose in China Hunan, China Qinghai, Mongolia, Russia, Japan, Korea, Laos and Hong Kong during 2007-2011, indicating that the virus has retro-infected diverse wild birds from chicken, and significant spread of the virus is still ongoing through overlapping migratory flyways. On the basis of the molecular analysis, we also found that there was a deletion of the glycosylation site (NSS) in amino acid 156 of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein when compared with that of the other Clade 2.3.2 viruses isolated between 2007 and 2011. More importantly, the sequence analysis of SW/SH/09 virus displayed the drug-resistant mutations on the matrix protein (M2) and neuraminidase (NA) genes."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a regulatory role in viral infection and may be involved in the mammalian immune response. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of host miRNA expression in TGEV-infected swine testis (ST) cells. Deep sequencing generated 3,704,353 and 2,763,665 reads from uninfected ST cells and infected ST cells, respectively. The reads were aligned to known Sus scrofa pre-miRNAs in miRBase 19, identifying 284 annotated miRNAs. Certain miRNAs were differentially regulated during TGEV infection. 59 unique miRNAs displayed significant differentially expression between the normal and TGEV-infected ST cell samples: 15 miRNAs were significantly up-regulated and 44 were significantly down-regulated. Stem-loop RT-PCR was carried out to determine the expression levels of specific miRNAs in the two samples, and the results were consistent with those of sequencing. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of host target genes demonstrated that the differentially expressed miRNAs are involved in regulatory networks, including cellular process, metabolic process, immune system process. This is the first report of the identification of ST cell miRNAs and the comprehensive analysis of the miRNA regulatory mechanism during TGEV infection, which revealed the miRNA molecular regulatory mechanisms for the viral infection, expression of viral genes and the expression of immune-related genes.

In the study, the complete genome sequence of strain A2 was sequenced and analyzed, which was a predominant IBV strain in China. The results indicated that there were mutations, insertions, and deletions distributed in the whole genome. The A2 virus had the highest identity to S14 and BJ in terms of full genome, whereas had a further distance to Massachusetts strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that A2 isolate clustered together with most Chinese strains. The results of this study suggest that strain A2 may play an important role in IBV's evolution and A2-like IBVs are predominant strains in China."

A large-scale sequence analysis of the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource Database on H1N1 SIVs submitted primarily by scientists in China during 1992 to 2011 was performed. The aims of this study were to elucidate the genetic and evolutionary characteristics of H1N1 SIVs, to identify and unify the lineages and genetic characteristics of the H1N1 SIVs isolated in mainland China. Most of the strains were isolated during the period of 2008 to 2010 from Guangdong and Shandong provinces, China. Based on the phylogenetic and genotypic analyses, all of the H1N1 SIV strains can be classified into 8 lineages and 10 genotypes. All strains were of the characteristics of low pathogenic influenza viruses. The viruses of different lineage are characterized with different amino acid residues at the receptor-binding sites. Viruses containing PB2 genes of the classical swine, early seasonal human and recent seasonal human lineage might be more infectious to human. Some genotypes were directly related with human influenza viruses, which include strains that harbored genes derived from human influenza viruses. Phylogenetic diversity and complexity existed in H1N1 SIVs isolated in mainland China. These H1N1 SIV strains were closely related to other subtype influenza viruses, especially to human influenza viruses. Moreover, it was shown that, novel lineages and genotypes of H1N1 SIVs emerged recently in mainland China. These findings provided new and essential information for further understanding of the genetic and evolutionary characteristics and monitoring the H1N1 SIVs in mainland China."

In this study, we tried to demonstrate the correlation between this molecular classification scheme and clinical manifestations in patients. We retrospectively reclassified the clinical isolates of enteroviruses from the preceding 4.5 years in our virology laboratory using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and reviewed the clinical manifestations of 138 pediatric patients. We reclassified 23 isolates of the five serotypes into the HEV-A group, 110 isolates of 16 sero-types into the HEV-B group, five isolates into the HEV-C group, and no isolate of the HEV-D group. HEV-A species caused significantly more hand-foot-and-mouth disease (p < 0.001), herpangina (p = 0.029), and myoclonic jerks (p < 0.001) compared with HEV-B species. However, HEV-B species caused significantly more pharyngitis (p = 0.043), respiratory tract infections (p = 0.046), nausea and vomiting (p = 0.007), and aseptic meningitis (p = 0.001). The only death in our report was caused by coxsackievirus A16, which belonged to the HEV-A group. The association between the molecular classification of enteroviruses and related disease patterns is an important finding. We suggest that this molecular classification could be applied in a clinical laboratory as an alternative method under certain circumstances, such as limited availability of antisera or questionable serotyping results, to identify the untypeable isolates."

Bats of the genus Pteropus appear to be the natural reservoir of this virus. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity of Nipah virus, to estimate the date of origin and the spread of the infection. The mean value of Nipah virus N gene evolutionary rate, was 6.5âÃâ10(-4) substitution/site/year (95% HPD: 2.3âÃâ10(-4)-1.18âÃâ10(-3)). The time-scaled phylogenetic analysis showed that the root of the tree originated in 1947 (95% HPD: 1888-1988) as the virus entered in south eastern Asiatic regions. The segregation of sequences in two main clades (I and II) indicating that Nipah virus had two different introductions: one in 1995 (95% HPD: 1985-2002) which correspond to clade I, and the other in 1985 (95% HPD: 1971-1996) which correspond to clade II. The phylogeographic reconstruction indicated that the epidemic followed two different routes spreading to the other locations. The trade of infected pigs may have played a role in the spread of the virus. Bats of the Pteropus genus, that are able to travel to long distances, may have contributed to the spread of the infection. Negatively selected sites, statistically supported, could reflect the stability of the viral N protein."

The occurrence of PiCV infections in pigeons (Columba livia) has been documented worldwide over the past 20 years; however, in Brazil there were still no reports on PiCV detection. This study identifies seven PiCV genomes recovered from domestic pigeons of South Brazil through high-throughput sequencing and shows a high frequency of PiCV infection, through quantitative real-time PCR. Phylogenetic classification was performed by maximum likelihood analysis of the full genomes, ORF V1 (Rep) and ORF C1 (Cap). The results show that either full genome or Cap based analysis allowed PiCV classification into five major clades (groups A to E), where Brazilian sequences were classified as A, C or D. Recombination analyses were carried out with Simplot and RDP4 and the results show that both Rep and Cap ORFs contain several recombination hotspots, pointing to an important role for such events in PiCV evolution."

In this study, we evaluated the faecal virome of juvenile and adult foxes from peri-urban areas in central Croatia. The dominating mammalian viruses were fox picobirnavirus and parvovirus. The highest number of viral reads (N=1412) was attributed to a new fox circovirus and complete viral genome was de novo assembled from the high-throughput sequencing data. Fox circovirus is highly similar to dog circoviruses identified in diseased dogs in USA and Italy, and to a recently discovered circovirus of foxes with neurologic disease from the United Kingdom. Our fox picobirnavirus was more closely related to the porcine and human picobirnaviruses than to known fox picobirnaviruses."

In this study, we defined the lumenal and mucosal bacterial communities from the small intestine (ileum) and large intestine (cecum and colon) plus feces, and characterized the effects of in-feed antibiotics (chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine and penicillin (ASP250)) on these communities. 16S rRNA gene sequence and metagenomic analyses of bacterial membership and functions revealed dramatic differences between small and large intestinal locations, including enrichment of Firmicutes and phage-encoding genes in the ileum. The large intestinal microbiota encoded numerous genes to degrade plant cell wall components, and these genes were lacking in the ileum. The mucosa-associated ileal microbiota harbored greater bacterial diversity than the lumen but similar membership to the mucosa of the large intestine, suggesting that most gut microbes can associate with the mucosa and might serve as an inoculum for the lumen. The collateral effects on the microbiota of antibiotic-fed animals caused divergence from that of control animals, with notable changes being increases in Escherichia coli populations in the ileum, Lachnobacterium spp. in all gut locations, and resistance genes to antibiotics not administered. Characterizing the differential metabolic capacities and response to perturbation at distinct intestinal locations will inform strategies to improve gut health and food safety."

The subgroup-specific epitopes are conformational and appear to be present on trimeric but not monomeric VP6. We have identified on VP6 some of the amino acids that determine the reactivity of the subgroup-specific mAbs 255/60 and 631/9. A single amino acid mutation at positions 172 (Met to Ala) or 305 (Asn to Ala) was sufficient to change the subgroup specificity of the human rotavirus Wa VP6 protein from SGII to SGI/II, since either of these mutations allowed the protein to be recognized by the SGI mAb 255/60, while retaining its capacity to interact with the SGII mAb 631/9. In the case of the SGII epitope, the mutation of two contiguous amino acids (Ala305 Asn306 to Asn305 Ala306) in the porcine rotavirus YM VP6 protein (SGI) enabled the protein to be efficiently recognized by the SGII mAb 631/9, while causing the YM VP6 protein to lose its capacity to interact with mAb 255/60. These results suggest that both subgroup Abs interact with an antigenic domain in VP6 that is composed of at least two regions of the protein that, although distant in the linear sequence, might be in close proximity in the structured VP6 trimer."

Other poxviruses have since been developed as vaccine vectors for clinical and veterinary applications and include modified vaccinia virus strains such as modified vaccinia Ankara and NYVAC as well as the avipox viruses, fowlpox virus and canarypox virus. Despite the empirical development of poxvirus-based vectored vaccines, it is only now becoming apparent that we need to better understand how the innate arm of the immune system drives adaptive immunity to poxviruses, and how this information is relevant to vaccine design strategies, which are the topics addressed in this article."

The 5â² untranslated region (5â² UTR) plays an important role in picornavirus translation initiation, as it contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that mediates cap-independent translation.

Results showed that deletions within the first 63ânt had little impact on IRES activity, whilst core IRES function was contained within stemâloops C and D, as their removal abrogated IRES activity significantly. In contrast to these findings, removal of stemâloop G containing two cryptic AUGs caused a remarkable increase in IRES activity, which was further investigated by site-directed mutagenesis at these two positions. It was also confirmed that initiation of protein synthesis occurs at AUG6 (position 391â394) and not at the AUG immediately downstream of the polypyrimidine tract. Mutation of the polypyrimidine tract (CCTTTC) had a slight effect on EoPV IRES activity.

Previous studies illustrated that at least three sublineages had been established in terrestrial poultry of Eurasian avian. In this presentation, eight full-length genes of an H9N2 strain, A/Chicken/Shanghai/F/98 (Ck/SH/F/98) were obtained. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic studies were conducted by comparing eight genes with those of all the available H9N2 strains from the GenBank. The results showed that four genes (HA, NA, M and NS genes) of Ck/SH/F/98 were incorporated into the sublineage represented by the early mainland China strain, Ck/BJ/1/94. However, the other four of RNP genes of Ck/SH/F/98 did not show close relationship with those of the three known sublineages' viruses. Therefore, Ck/SH/F/98 was a natural reassortant between different sublineages. In addition, comparison showed that Ck/SH/F/98 could be a putative precursor of a later isolate from southern China, Dk/ST/1605/01, with at least six genes of both closely related, indicating genes of Ck/SH/F/98 and early isolates had ever been circulating. Further comparison in terms of molecular markers of species specificity of HA1 revealed that DK/ST/1605/01 also resembled Ck/SH/F/98 more than a common earlier duck strain. The results supported the idea of two-way transmission between terrestrial and aquatic birds that emphasized the importance to raise concerns on the natural evolution of all the eight genes of H9N2 avian influenza viruses."

Geese are capable of rapid growth, disease resistance, and high liver lipid storage capacity, and can be easily fed coarse fodder. Here, we sequence and analyze the whole-genome sequence of an economically important goose breed in China and compare it with that of terrestrial bird species. A draft sequence of the whole-goose genome was obtained by shotgun sequencing, and 16,150 protein-coding genes were predicted. Comparative genomics indicate that significant differences occur between the goose genome and that of other terrestrial bird species, particularly regarding major histocompatibility complex, Myxovirus resistance, Retinoic acid-inducible gene I, and other genes related to disease resistance in geese. In addition, analysis of transcriptome data further reveals a potential molecular mechanism involved in the susceptibility of geese to fatty liver disease and its associated symptoms, including high levels of unsaturated fatty acids and low levels of cholesterol. The results of this study show that deletion of the goose lep gene might be the result of positive selection, thus allowing the liver to adopt energy storage mechanisms for long-distance migration. This is the first report describing the complete goose genome sequence and contributes to genomic resources available for studying aquatic birds. The findings in this study are useful not only for genetic breeding programs, but also for studying lipid metabolism disorders."

Cameroon presents a unique opportunity for epidemiological studies because FMD vaccination is not practiced. We carried out a prospective study including serological, antigenic and genetic aspects of FMD virus (FMDV) infections among different livestock production systems in the Far North of Cameroon to gain insight into the natural ecology of the virus. We found serological evidence of FMDV infection in over 75% of the animals sampled with no significant differences of prevalence observed among the sampled groups (i.e. market, sedentary, transboundary trade and mobile). We also found antibodies reactive to five of the seven FMDV serotypes (A, O, SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3) among the animals sampled. Finally, we were able to genetically characterize viruses obtained from clinical and subclinical FMD infections in Cameroon. Serotype O viruses grouped into two topotypes (West and East Africa). SAT2 viruses grouped with viruses from Central and Northern Africa, notably within the sublineage causing the large epidemic in Northern Africa in 2012, suggesting a common origin for these viruses. This research will guide future interventions for the control of FMD such as improved diagnostics, guidance for vaccine formulation and epidemiological understanding in support of the progressive control of FMD in Cameroon."

Bat infection was supported by relatively high EV-G concentrations of 1.1Ã106âRNA copies per gram of faeces. All other bat viruses belonged either to the bat-associated genus Mischivirus, or to an unclassified Picornaviridae group distantly related to the genus Sapelovirus. Members of this unclassified sapelovirus-related group had RNA secondary structures in their 3'-nontranslated regions that were typical of enteroviruses and that resembled structures that occur in bat-associated coronaviruses, suggesting ancient recombination events. Based on sequence distances, several picornaviruses from European and Chinese bats were likely conspecific, suggesting connectivity of virus populations. Due to their high mutation rates and their diversity, picornaviruses may be useful tools for studies of bat and virus ecology."

We identified and analyzed 472 sequences of parvoviruses, among which there were (virtually) full-length genomes of all 41 viruses currently recognized as individual species within the family Parvoviridae. Our phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomes as well as open reading frames distinguished three evolutionary groups of parvoviruses from vertebrates: (i) the human helper-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes 1 to 6 and the autonomous avian parvoviruses; (ii) the bovine, chipmunk, and autonomous primate parvoviruses, including human viruses B19 and V9; and (iii) the parvoviruses from rodents (except for chipmunks), carnivores, and pigs. Each of these three evolutionary groups could be further subdivided, reflecting both virus-host coevolution and multiple cross-species transmissions in the evolutionary history of parvoviruses. No parvoviruses from invertebrates clustered with vertebrate parvoviruses. Our analysis provided evidence for negative selection among parvoviruses, the independent evolution of their genes, and recombination among parvoviruses from rodents. The topology of the phylogenetic tree of autonomous human and simian parvoviruses matched exactly the topology of the primate family tree, as based on the analysis of primate mitochondrial DNA. Viruses belonging to the AAV group were not evolutionarily linked to other primate parvoviruses but were linked to the parvoviruses of birds. The two lineages of human parvoviruses may have resulted from independent ancient zoonotic infections. Our results provide an argument for reclassification of Parvovirinae based on evolutionary relationships among viruses."

Phylogenetic analysis distinguished two deep-rooted groups: one comprising mammalian astroviruses, with ovine astrovirus being an outlier, and the other comprising avian astroviruses. All virus species as well as serotypes of human astroviruses represented individual lineages within the tree. All human viruses clustered together and separately from non-human viruses, which argue for their common evolutionary origin and against ongoing animal-to-human transmissions. The branching order of mammalian astroviruses was exactly the opposite of that of their host species, suggesting at least two cross-species transmissions involving pigs, cats and humans, possibly through intermediate hosts. Analysis of synonymous (Ds) versus non-synonymous (Da) distances revealed that negative selection is dominating in the evolution of astroviruses, with the Ds:Da ratios being up to 46 for the comparisons of the most closely related viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of all open reading frames (ORFs) based on Ds resulted in the loss of tree structures, with virus species â and in ORF2, even serotypes of human astroviruses â branching out from virtually a single node, suggesting their ancient separation. The strong selection against non-synonymous substitutions, the low number of which is, therefore, not proof of a recent separation between lineages, together with the position of the oldest available human astrovirus strain (1971) far from the common node of its serotype 4, suggest that intraserotype diversification originates from an earlier date.</jats:p>"

Recently the severe acute form has been related only to some hypervirulent BVDV-2 strains. This article reports the detection of BVDV-1b associated with an acute and fatal outbreak of BVD in a Brazilian beef cattle herd. Depression, anorexia, watery diarrhea, sialorrhea, and weakness were observed in six steers. One of these animals was evaluated for laboratorial, clinical, and pathological alterations. Laboratory findings were non-specific; clinically, the animal was weak, with dehydration and erosive oral lesions. Pathological alterations were predominant at the tongue, esophagus, and rumen. A RT-PCR assay using primers to partially amplify the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the BVDV genome was performed and identified BVDV in all clinical samples analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis of BVDV derived from lymph node revealed that this strain was clustered within the BVDV subtype 1b. This differentiating was only possible to be performed by molecular characterization since both clinical presentation and pathologic findings were similar to BVDV-2 infection."

Recently, PR outbreaks occurred in a large number of Bartha-K61-vaccinated swine herds in many regions of China. Here, we isolated a PRV variant, named TJ strain, from a Bartha-K61-vaccinated pig farm in China, evaluated the pathogenicity of the TJ strain in susceptible animals and analyzed its complete genomic sequence obtained by 454 pyrosequencing. Vaccination-challenge experiment in sheep showed that the classical Bartha-K61 vaccine could not provide complete protection against the challenge with the PRV TJ strain. In mice, the 50% lethal dose (LD50) of the TJ strain (10(2.3) TCID50) was lower than that of the classical PRV SC strain (10(3.0) TCID50). Furthermore, the TJ strain displayed higher mortality for pigs, as compared with the SC strain. The PRV TJ strain genome was determined to be 143,642 bp in length, encoding 67 open reading frames. The TJ strain was clustered to an independent branch together with some recent PRV isolates in China in the phylogenetic tree, which was relatively distant from previous PRV isolates. The TJ strain showed unique variations in the viral proteins that play key roles in the viral replication cycle.

It was isolated in specific-pathogen-free eggs and molecularly characterized in the hypervariable region of the virus protein (VP) 2. Phylogenetic analysis showed that ITA strains clustered separately from other homologous reference sequences of IBDVs, either classical or very virulent, retrieved from GenBank or previously reported in Italy, and from vaccine strains. The new genotype shows peculiar molecular characteristics in key positions of the VP2 hypervariable region, which affect charged or potentially glycosylated amino acids virtually associated with important changes in virus properties. Characterization of 41 IBDV strains detected in Italy between 2013 and 2014 showed that ITA is emergent in densely populated poultry areas of Italy, being 68% of the IBDV detections made during routine diagnostic activity over a two-year period, in spite of the immunity induced by large-scale vaccination. Four very virulent strains (DV86) and one classical strain (HPR2), together with eight vaccine strains, were also detected. The currently available epidemiological and clinical data do not allow the degree of pathogenicity of the ITA genotype to be defined. Only in vivo experimental pathogenicity studies conducted in secure isolation conditions, through the evaluation of clinical signs and macro/microscopic lesions, will clarify conclusively the virulence of the new Italian genotype."

The purpose of the present study was to develop and validate real time RT-PCR assays for the detection of BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1 in brain tissues of cattle. Three different primer-probe combinations were designed based on BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1 full-genome sequences of 11 different strains identified in cattle, and established in three distinct one-step real time RT-PCR protocols. These protocols were compared regarding their diagnostic performance using brain tissues of cattle with and without astrovirus associated encephalitis. The limit of detection (LOD) of all three assays was between 1.34âÃâ10<jats:sup>1</jats:sup> and 1.34âÃâ10<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> RNA copies, leading to an analytical sensitivity two orders of magnitude superior compared to a conventional pan-astrovirus RT-PCR protocol (LOD 1.31âÃâ10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> RNA copies). Amplification efficiency was in the range of 97.3% to 107.5% with linearity (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>)â&gt;â0.99. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the assays was determined as 100%, and all three revealed good intra- and inter-test repeatability. In conclusion, the newly developed RT-qPCRs are sensitive, specific, and reliable test formats that will facilitate BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1 detection in routine diagnostics as well as in research settings.</jats:p>"

To better understand the genetic basis of the pathogenic characteristics changed and increased virulence, we sequenced the genomes of six new GaHV-2 strains (LCC, LTS, WC/1203, JL/1404, CC/1409, and HS/1412) isolated from chickens with failed immunisation as well as one previously isolated Chinese GaHV-2 strain, J-1. Based on a multiple sequence alignment, several characteristic point mutations were detected in the open reading frames of the Chinese isolates. In addition, two deletions and an insertion were identified at the unique short region and terminal repeat short region junctions in Chinese isolates, and the insertion was a characteristic of the new Chinese isolates. According to a phylogenetic analysis, the GaHV-2 genome diverged substantially over the last two decades in China. Based on the internal repeat long region, the new isolates were closely related to very virulent or very virulent plus strains. Additionally, the new Chinese isolates diverged from the previously isolated strains J-1 and 814. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that Chinese GaHV-2 strains contain characteristic sequences, especially the new isolates. The observed genetic divergence in the new Chinese GaHV-2 strains over the last two decades may be related to observed changes in pathogenic characteristics and virulence."

FMDV infects cloven-hoofed animals, such as pigs, sheep, goats, cattle and diverse wildlife species, and remains a major threat to the livestock industry worldwide. In this study, a transcriptome analysis of whole blood from pigs infected with FMDV was performed using the paired-end Illumina sequencing technique to understand the interactions between the pathogen and its host cells. During infection with FMDV, a total of 120 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including 110 up-regulated genes and 10 down-regulated genes. To further investigate the DEGs involved in interactions between the virus and its host, gene ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment were conducted. GO annotation indicated that a number of DEGs were enriched in categories involved in host-virus interactions, such as response to stimulus, immune system process and regulation of biological process. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the DEGs were primarily involved in the ribosome signaling pathway and immune-related signaling pathways. Ten DEGs, including the immune-related genes BTK1, C1QB, TIMD4 and CXCL10, were selected and validated using quantitative PCR, which showed that the expression patterns of these genes are consistent with the results of the in silico expression analysis. In conclusion, this study presents the first transcriptome analysis of pig whole blood cells infected with FMDV, and the results obtained in this study improve our understanding of the interactions between FMDV and host cells as well as the diagnosis and control of FMD."

Three pairs of primers for nanoPCR developed in this study were selected from conserved regions of PRV, producing specific amplicons of 431 bp (gB), 316 bp (gE), and 202 bp (gG). The sensitivity of this assay using purified plasmid constructs containing the specific gene fragments was 100-1000 fold higher than conventional PCR. The PRV nanoPCR assay did not amplify porcine parvovirus, porcine circovirus type 2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine teschovirus, or African swine fever virus but produced three bands of expected size with PRV and two bands of expected size with the gene-deleted PRV-Bartha-K61.

The causative agent, bluetongue virus (BTV), is spread through temperate and tropical regions of the world by biting Culicoides midges. Control of BTV infection is complicated by the plurality of virus serotypes and the ubiquity and opportunistic feeding behavior of its midge vector. The global distribution of BTV infection has recently altered, perhaps driven in part by climatic influences on midge species resident in different regions. The goal of this review is to evaluate realistic strategies that might be utilized to control or prevent future outbreaks of BT and other Culicoides-transmitted diseases. Importantly, optimal control of emerging, rapidly evolving arbovirus diseases such as BT will require integrated countermeasures that mitigate all aspects of the virus's transmission cycle. This will best be accomplished using preventative, rather than purely reactive strategies."

During the ongoing study of Danish isolates of PRRSV by means of nucleotide sequencing, RT-PCR reactions and subsequent nucleotide sequencing showed the presence of American type PRRSV in Danish breeding herds. Most likely, these atypical viruses originated from boars vaccinated with live vaccine of American type (MLV RespPRRS), which were taken to artificial insemination centres and there brought together with unvaccinated boars already at the centres. The nucleotide sequences of three Danish viruses of American type PRRSV were compared to those of known PRRSV isolates. The nucleotide sequence identities of the atypical Danish isolates were between 99.2-99.5% to the vaccine virus RespPRRS and 99.0-99.3% to VR2332 which are the parental virus to the vaccine virus. Phylogenetic analysis including field isolates of American type supports the conclusion that the introduction of American type PRRSV in Denmark was due to spread of vaccine virus."

The RNA tumor viruses have been historically classified into two groups, acute transforming RNA tumor viruses and nonacute RNA tumor viruses. Acute transforming RNA tumor viruses are basically replication-defective and rapidly induce tumors by expressing the viral oncogenes captured from cellular genome in host cells. The first oncogene derived from Rous sarcoma virus was the src non-receptor tyrosine kinase, which has been identified to play the significant roles for signal transduction. On the other hand, nonacute RNA tumor viruses, which consist of only gag, pro, pol, and env regions but do not carry oncogenes, are replication-competent and could activate the cellular proto-oncogenes by inserting the viral long terminal repeat close to the proto-oncogenes to induce tumors with a long incubation period, as is termed a promoter insertion. These molecular mechanisms have been thought to induce tumors. However, very recently several reports have described that the retroviral structural protein Envelope could directly induce tumors in vivo and transform cells in vitro. These are very unusual examples of native retroviral structural proteins with transformation potential. In this review we look back over the history of oncogenic retrovirus research and summarize recent progress for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of oncogenic transformation by retrovirus Envelope proteins."

This study investigated cellular miRNA expression profiles operating in response to influenza virus in early stage of infection which might be useful for understanding and control of viral infection. A549 cells were infected with different subtypes of influenza virus (pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1). After 24âh post-infection, miRNAs were extracted and then used for DNA library construction. All DNA libraries with different indexes were pooled together with equal concentration, followed by high-throughput sequencing based on MiSeq platform. The miRNAs were identified and counted from sequencing data by using MiSeq reporter software. The miRNAs expressions were classified into up and downregulated miRNAs compared to those found in non-infected cells. Mostly, each subtype of influenza A virus triggered the upregulated responses in miRNA expression profiles. Hsa-miR-101, hsa-miR-193b, hsa-miR-23b, and hsa-miR-30e* were upregulated when infected with all three subtypes of influenza A virus. Target prediction results showed that virus infection can trigger genes in cellular process, metabolic process, developmental process and biological regulation. This study provided some insights into the cellular miRNA profiling in response to various subtypes of influenza A viruses in circulation and which have caused outbreaks in human population. The regulated miRNAs might be involved in virusâhost interaction or host defense mechanism, which should be investigated for effective antiviral therapeutic interventions. </jats:p>"

The virus is classified in genotypes with different epidemiological relevance and clinical implications. The present study reports the development and validation of specific RT-qPCR assays for the detection of two major IBV genotypes: South America I (SAI) and Asia/South America II (A/SAII). The SAI genotype is an exclusive and widespread South American lineage while the A/SAII genotype is distributed in Asia, Europe and South America. Both identification assays employ TaqMan probes that hybridize with unique sequences in the spike glycoprotein gene. The assays successfully detected all the assessed strains belonging to both genotypes, showing high specificity and absence of cross-reactivity. Using serial dilutions of in vitro-transcribed RNA we obtained acceptable determination coefficients, PCR efficiencies and relatively small intra- and inter-assay variability. The assays demonstrated a wide dynamic range between 10(1)-10(7) and 10(2)-10(7) RNA copies/reaction for SAI and A/SAII strains, respectively. The possibility to characterize a large number of samples in a rapid, sensitive and reproducible way makes these techniques suitable tools for routine testing, IBV control, and epidemiological research in poultry."

The virus is classified in genotypes and lineages with different epidemiological relevance. Two lineages of the GI genotype (11 and 16) have been widely circulating for decades in South America. GI-11 is an exclusive South American lineage while the GI-16 lineage is distributed in Asia, Europe and South America. Here, we obtained the whole genome of two Uruguayan strains of the GI-11 and GI-16 lineages using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The strains here sequenced are the first obtained in South America for the infectious bronchitis virus and provide new insights into the origin, spreading and evolution of viral variants. The complete genome of the GI-11 and GI-16 strains have 27,621 and 27,638 nucleotides, respectively, and possess the same genomic organization. Phylogenetic incongruence analysis reveals that both strains have a mosaic genome that arose by recombination between Euro Asiatic strains of the GI-16 lineage and ancestral South American GI-11 viruses. The recombination occurred in South America and produced two viral variants that have retained the full-length S1 sequences of the parental lineages but are extremely similar in the rest of their genomes. These recombinant virus have been extraordinary successful, persisting in the continent for several years with a notorious wide geographic distribution. Our findings reveal a singular viral dynamics and emphasize the importance of complete genomic characterization to understand the emergence and evolutionary history of viral variants."

In this study, we analysed a cohort of 143 rabies viruses circulating in Sudan collected from 10 different animal species between 1992 and 2006. Partial nucleoprotein sequence data (400 bp) were obtained and compared to available sequence data of African classical rabies virus (RABV) isolates. The Sudanese sequences formed a discrete cluster within the Africa 1a group, including a small number of sequences that clustered with sequences from Ethiopian RABV. These latter sequences share an Aspartic Acid at position 106 (Asp(106)) with all other Africa 1a group members, in contrast to the remaining Sudanese strains, which encode Glutamic Acid at this position (Glu(106)). Furthermore, when representatives of other African and European lineages were aligned, Glu(106) is unique to Sudan, which supports the concept of a single distinct virus strain circulating in Sudan. The high sequence identity in all Sudanese isolates studied, demonstrates the presence of a single rabies virus biotype for which the principal reservoir is the domestic dog."

The aim of this study was to investigate pestivirus infections in wild and domestic ruminants sharing pastures in the French Southern Alps. Animal sera were screened for pestivirus antibodies against the pestivirus NS3 protein by a commercial blocking enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All 38 domestic herds tested were positive for pestivirus-specific antibodies. Individual sero-prevalence reached 76.5% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: [74.2-78.8%]) of the 1383 sheep tested. For wild ruminants, 38.7% (95% CI: [33.8-43.9%]) of the 369 chamois tested, 28.7% (95% CI: [17.4-38.1%]) of the 72 roe deer, and 22.2% (95% CI: [6.5-37.9%]) of the 27 mouflons were seropositive. Virus screening was carried out on spleen samples from hunted wild animals (n=160) and from 15 domestic ruminants (clinically suspected to be persistently infected animals), by a conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Three pestivirus strains were isolated from the sheep samples positive by RT-PCR. The viruses were classified in the BDV-3, BDV-Tunisian and BDV-6 genotypes. For the first time, one strain (RUPI-05 strain) was isolated from an alpine chamois and clustered in the BDV-6 genotype, showing in the 5'-UTR region 92% of identity with the ovine isolate from the same area. Thus, an active circulation of pestiviruses was demonstrated in both wild and domestic ungulates from the French Southern Alps. The results suggest that interspecies transmission between sheep and chamois probably occur."

Besides the well known plant and animal-infecting ssDNA viruses, it has recently become apparent through metagenomic surveys of ssDNA molecules that there also exist large numbers of other diverse ssDNA viruses within almost all terrestrial and aquatic environments. The host ranges of these viruses probably span the tree of life and they are likely to be important components of global ecosystems. Various lines of evidence suggest that a pivotal evolutionary process during the generation of this global ssDNA virus diversity has probably been genetic recombination. High rates of homologous recombination, non-homologous recombination and genome component reassortment are known to occur within and between various different ssDNA virus species and we look here at the various roles that these different types of recombination may play, both in the day-to-day biology, and in the longer term evolution, of these viruses. We specifically focus on the ecological, biochemical and selective factors underlying patterns of genetic exchange detectable amongst the ssDNA viruses and discuss how these should all be considered when assessing the adaptive value of recombination during ssDNA virus evolution."

This heterogeneity has an effect on antigenic composition of PRRSV and might create differences in sensitivity to neutralization between isolates. The sensitivity to neutralization could be an important feature of PRRSV isolates because it is likely that isolates resistant to neutralization pose a significant challenge for the development of vaccines that elicit broad protective immunity. Nonetheless, little information is available for understanding or categorizing the viral neutralization phenotype of PRRSV isolates. Consequently, the main purpose of this study was to determine whether PRRSV isolates differ in their susceptibility to neutralization and if they can be classified in different categories based on their neutralization phenotype. For this purpose, a panel of 39 PRRSV isolates and a set of 30 hyperimmune monospecific sera were used in cross-neutralization assays. The results of this study indicate that PRRSV isolates differ in their sensitivity to neutralization and k-means clustering system allowed classifying the isolates in four different categories according to their neutralization phenotype: highly sensitive, sensitive, moderately sensitive and resistant to neutralization. Further analyses using two additional clustering systems that considered individual data for the classification of the isolates confirmed that classification obtained by k-means is accurate in most cases and that only in a few instances classification is less stringent. Sequences of GP3, GP4 and GP5 were analyzed but no correlation could be found between the sequence of previously identified neutralizing epitopes or the number of N-linked glycosylation sites in different proteins and the neutralization phenotype of the isolates. These data provide the first systematic assessment of overall neutralization sensitivities of a panel of diverse PRRSV isolates. The classification of the isolates provides a useful tool to facilitate the systematic characterization of neutralizing antibody production elicited by new vaccine candidates."

This has resulted in increased contact between humans and pigs. Pigs can act as reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases. Therefore identification of potential zoonotic pathogens is important for public health surveillance. In this study, during a routine general surveillance for African swine fever, domestic pigs from Uganda were screened for the presence of RNA and DNA viruses using a high-throughput pyrosequencing method. Serum samples from 16 domestic pigs were collected from five regions in Uganda and pooled accordingly. Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted and sequenced on the 454 GS-FLX platform. Among the sequences assigned to a taxon, 53% mapped to the domestic pig (Sus scrofa). African swine fever virus, Torque teno viruses (TTVs), and porcine endogenous retroviruses were identified. Interestingly, two pools (B and C) of RNA origin had sequences that showed 98% sequence identity to Ndumu virus (NDUV). None of the reads had identity to the class Insecta indicating that these sequences were unlikely to result from contamination with mosquito nucleic acids. This is the first report of the domestic pig as a vertebrate host for Ndumu virus. NDUV had been previously isolated only from culicine mosquitoes. NDUV therefore represents a potential zoonotic pathogen, particularly given the increasing risk of human-livestock-mosquito contact."

Antigenic relatedness between SPV and vaccinia was also analyzed using immunoprecipitations and revealed little if any cross-reactivity. The growth characteristics of SPV in tissue culture were examined by light microscopy and revealed both a delayed and a different cytopathology than that of vaccinia virus. SPV causes foci in pig kidney cells that are not evident until at least 4 days postinfection, whereas vaccinia rapidly generates plaques on these cells. The kinetics of DNA accumulation, protein expression, and RNA transcription of SPV have been examined and indicate that each of these facets of the SPV growth cycle is also considerably delayed when compared to vaccinia virus.

Here, we report the identification of a novel bovine group A rotavirus from diarrhea of adult cows. A group A rotavirus was detected from an epizootic outbreak of diarrhea in adult cows with a decrease in milk production in Japan in 2013. The comprehensive genomic analyses from fecal samples by viral metagenomics using a next-generation sequencer revealed that it had an unreported genotype combination G15P[14]. The genome constellation of this strain, namely, RVA/Cow-wt/JPN/Tottori-SG/2013/G15P[14] was G15-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T6-E2-H3 representing VP7-VP4-VP6-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5, respectively. Each gene segment of Tottori-SG was most closely related to Japanese bovine group A rotaviruses suggesting that Tottori-SG might have derived from multiple reassortment events from group A rotavirus strains circulating among Japanese cattle. No other diarrhea pathogen of adult cattle was detected by routine diagnosis and metagenomics. Viral metagenomics, using a next-generation sequencer, is useful to characterize group A rotaviruses from fecal samples and offers unbiased comprehensive investigations of pathogen."

The genome of the virus, named Sapelo-like porcine picornavirus Japan (SPPVJ) Pig/Isi-Im1/JPN/2016, had a type-IV internal ribosomal entry site and carried a 6978-nucleotide-long single open reading frame encoding a 2326 amino acids (aa) polyprotein precursor. The coding sequence region consisted of leader protein (68 aa), a structural protein region P1 (824 aa), and the non-structural protein regions P2 (672 aa) and P3 (762 aa). Among representative picornaviruses, the P1, 2C, and 3CD regions of SPPVJ had the highest aa identities of 64.4%, 61.9%, and 73.3%, respectively, with the corresponding regions of sapelo-like bat picornavirus BtVs-PicoV/SC2013. Sequencing analysis of the RT-PCR products derived from the 5' untranslated and 3D regions revealed the presence of SPPVJ in 17.8% (19/107) of the feces from healthy and diarrheal pigs in 12 farms in 2015-2016. Further studies are needed to determine the origin and pathogenic potential of SPPJV in pigs and other mammals."

The animals were established by integration of lambda EG10 phage DNA as a transgene into the genome. The inserted position of the transgene on chromosome was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization and Southern blot analyses; however, the exact position and sequence of the inserted junction were not known. To identify the site and pattern of genomic integration of the transgene copies, genomic DNAs extracted from C57BL/6J gpt delta mice and F344 gpt delta rats were applied to whole genome sequencing and mate-pair analysis. The result confirmed that multi-copy lambda EG10 transgenes are inserted at a single position in the mouse chromosome 17. The junction contains 70 bp of overlapped genomic sequences, and it has short homology at both ends. A copy number analysis suggested that the inserted transgenes may contain 41 head-to-tail junctions and 16 junctions of other types such as rearranged abnormal junctions. It suggested that the number of intact copies could be approximately 40 at maximum. In the F344 gpt delta rats, transgenes are inserted at a single position in the rat chromosome 4. The junction contains no overlapped sequence but 72-kb genomic sequence including one gene was deleted. The inserted transgenes may contain 15 head-to-tail junctions and two rearranged junctions. It suggested that the number of intact copies could be 14 at maximum. One germline base substitution in the gpt gene rescued from gpt delta rats was characterized. The exact inserted positions of the lambda EG10 transgene in the genome of gpt delta transgenic rodents were identified. The copy number and arrangement of the transgene were analyzed. PCR primers for quick genotyping of gpt delta mice and rats have been designed."

Circoviruses possess immuno-suppressive properties and might interfere with the health of wild birds. 83 birds, which belonged to 23 species, were tested with broad-range, nested PCR. The obtained PCR products were sequenced and new primers designed, to analyse the full-length, viral genome. A phylogenetic analysis was conducted, to find any relationship to known circoviruses. The circovirus DNA sequence was found in 4 birds. All samples originated from the velvet scoter (Melanitta fusca) a marine duck from the Merginae sub-family. Birds which tested positive for the circovirus were found dead in fishing nets, off the Baltic coast. During post-mortem examination, carcasses of two of the scoters showed only light emaciation, while the two other birds appeared healthy. The obtained, full-length, circovirus sequence revealed 1,988 nucleotides and the presence of typical features (i.e. Cap, Rep and ORF3). Nucleotide similarity to other duck circoviruses was 84 to 86 %. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome and cap gene, indicated that the new circovirus is related to known duck circoviruses, especially to sub-types sometimes referred to as duck circovirus genotype 1, but not genotype 2. In this study, we have reported a new duck circovirus sequence detected in the velvet scoter, a species of marine duck. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis of the new virus sequence support previous reports that duck circovirus (DuCV) is a species with a high degree of diversity. The viral sequence obtained from the velvet scoter suggests that DuCV may infect birds from the Anatinae sub-family. More studies are needed to prove if the velvet scoter and other marine ducks act as a reservoir for DuCV."

B-cell epitopes of African horse sickness virus (AHSV) have previously been mapped on VP2, VP5, VP7 and NS1, using mouse, rabbit and chicken monoclonal antibodies. A comprehensive study of the humoral immune response of five vaccinated horses to AHSV-4 antigenic peptides was undertaken. A fragmented-genome phage display library expressing a repertoire of AHSV-4 peptides spanning the entire genome was constructed. The library was affinity selected for binders on immobilised polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) isolated from horse sera collected pre- and post-immunisation with an attenuated AHSV-4 monovalent vaccine. The DNA inserts of binding phages were sequenced with Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The data were normalised using preimmune IgG-selected sequences. More sequences mapped to the genes coding for NS3, VP6 and VP5 than to the other genes. However, VP2 and VP5 each had more antigenic regions than each of the other proteins. This study identified a number of epitopes to which the horse's humoral immune system responds during immunisation with AHSV-4."

In some populations, PARV4 infection is uncommon, and evidence of exposure is found only in individuals with risk factors for parenteral infection who are infected with other blood-borne viruses. In other settings, seroprevalence studies suggest an endemic, age-associated transmission pattern, independent of any specific risk factors. The clinical impact of PARV4 infection remains uncertain, but reported disease associations include an influenza-like syndrome, encephalitis, acceleration of HIV disease, and foetal hydrops. In this review, we set out to report progress updates from the recent literature, focusing on the investigation of cohorts in different geographical settings, now including insights from Asia, the Middle East, and South America, and discussing whether attributes of viral or host populations underpin the striking differences in epidemiology. We review progress in understanding viral phylogeny and biology, approaches to diagnostics, and insights that might be gained from studies of closely related animal pathogens. Crucial questions about pathogenicity remain unanswered, but we highlight new evidence supporting a possible link between PARV4 and an encephalitis syndrome. The unequivocal evidence that PARV4 is endemic in certain populations should drive ongoing research efforts to understand risk factors and routes of transmission and to gain new insights into the impact of this virus on human health."

As reassortment of all the 11 rotavirus gene segments plays a key role in generating rotavirus diversity in nature, a classification system that is based on all the rotavirus gene segments is desirable for determining which genes influence rotavirus host range restriction, replication, and virulence, as well as for studying rotavirus epidemiology and evolution. Toward establishing such a classification system, gene sequences encoding VP1 to VP3, VP6, and NSP1 to NSP5 were determined for human and animal rotavirus strains belonging to different G and P genotypes in addition to those available in databases, and they were used to define phylogenetic relationships among all rotavirus genes. Based on these phylogenetic analyses, appropriate identity cutoff values were determined for each gene. For the VP4 gene, a nucleotide identity cutoff value of 80% completely correlated with the 27 established P genotypes. For the VP7 gene, a nucleotide identity cutoff value of 80% largely coincided with the established G genotypes but identified four additional distinct genotypes comprised of murine or avian rotavirus strains. Phylogenetic analyses of the VP1 to VP3, VP6, and NSP1 to NSP5 genes showed the existence of 4, 5, 6, 11, 14, 5, 7, 11, and 6 genotypes, respectively, based on nucleotide identity cutoff values of 83%, 84%, 81%, 85%, 79%, 85%, 85%, 85%, and 91%, respectively. In accordance with these data, a revised nomenclature of rotavirus strains is proposed. The novel classification system allows the identification of (i) distinct genotypes, which probably followed separate evolutionary paths; (ii) interspecies transmissions and a plethora of reassortment events; and (iii) certain gene constellations that revealed (a) a common origin between human Wa-like rotavirus strains and porcine rotavirus strains and (b) a common origin between human DS-1-like rotavirus strains and bovine rotaviruses. These close evolutionary links between human and animal rotaviruses emphasize the need for close simultaneous monitoring of rotaviruses in animals and humans."

Multiple novel genotypes were identified and genotype numbers were assigned by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group: R9 (VP1), C9 (VP2), N9 (NSP2), T12 (NSP3), E14 (NSP4), and H7 and H11 (NSP5). The genotype constellation of L338 was unique: G13-P[18]-I6-R9-C9-M6-A6-N9-T12-E14-H11. The six remaining equine RVA strains showed a largely conserved genotype constellation: G3/G14-P[12]-I2/I6-R2-C2-M3-A10-N2-T3-E2/E12-H7, which is highly divergent from other known non-equine RVA genotype constellations. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the sequences of these equine RVA strains are related distantly to non-equine RVA strains, and that at least three lineages exist within equine RVA strains. A small number of reassortment events were observed. Interestingly, the three RVA strains from Argentina possessed the E12 genotype, whereas the three RVA strains from Ireland and South Africa possessed the E2 genotype. The unusual E12 genotype has until now only been described in Argentina among RVA strains collected from guanaco, cattle and horses, suggesting geographical isolation of this NSP4 genotype. This conserved genetic configuration of equine RVA strains could be useful for future vaccine development or improvement of currently used equine RVA vaccines."

Multiple studies on virus classification and global epidemiological links have yielded consistent data. Here, we have performed a molecular analysis study of circulating Newcastle disease viruses in Iran (1995-2016). According to evolutionary divergences, subgenotype VIg, VIj, VIIj, VIId, XIIIa and XIIId isolates have been circulating in the country during a 21-year period. Based on data analysis, VIg isolates shared highest sequence identity with Russian and Polish isolates of the VIg subgenotype, while VIj subgenotype isolates (2012) were most similar to a virus isolated in 2015 in India. Analysis of the evolutionary divergence of subgenotype VIIj suggests that Chinese and Ukrainian viruses may have played a crucial role in the emergence of VIIj isolates. Evolutionary difference studies also indicated that XIIIa isolates circulating in Iran may have caused the emergence of adapted variants of subgenotype XIIId. Therefore, we propose that the evolutionary and epidemiological study of virulent Newcastle disease viruses could help to provide accurate molecular data about variants circulating in the region, thus aiding in the design of more efficient recombinant vaccines."

               <jats:p>Myxoma virus is an infectious poxvirus pathogen that induces a virulent systemic disease called myxomatosis in European rabbits. The disease is rapidly and uniformly fatal to susceptible rabbits and is characterized by generalized dysfunction of cellular immunity and multiple interruptions of the host cytokine network. A number of virus genes are classified as virulence factors because virus constructs bearing targeted gene disruptions induce attenuated disease symptoms. Many of these genes encode proteins that interact directly with effector elements of the host immune system. Included among these immunosubversive viral proteins are secreted mimics of host ligands or regulators (virokines) and homologues of cellular cytokine receptors (viroceptors). Five examples of these immune modulator proteins encoded by myxoma virus are reviewed: (1) myxoma growth factor, a member of the epidermal growth factor ligand superfamily; (2) SERP-1, a secreted serine proteinase inhibitor; (3) M11L, a receptor-like surface protein; (4) T2, a tumor necrosis factor receptor homologue; and (5) T7, an interferon-Î³ receptor homologue. The origin of viral strategies designed to subvert immune regulation by host cytokines is considered in the context of the biology of myxoma virus within immunocompetent hosts. J. Leukoc.

Strains T6, K43, and K87 were more than 99% homologous to previously described strains C and D. A fourth new strain (K32) was most closely related to the previously described B strain.

Although viral pathology and clinical disease in cattle appear mild, this virus plays an important role as a trigger of bovine respiratory disease (BRD). BRD is a costly illness worldwide. Thus, epidemiological surveys of the influenza D virus are necessary. Here, we conducted a molecular epidemiological survey for the influenza D virus in healthy and respiratory-diseased cattle in Japan. We found that 2.1% (8/377) of the cattle were infected with influenza D. The cattle with and without respiratory symptoms had approximately equal amounts of the virus. A full-genome sequence analysis revealed that the influenza D virus that was isolated in Japan formed an individual cluster that was distinct from the strains found in other countries. These results suggest that this virus might have evolved uniquely in Japan over a long period of time and that the viral pathology of Japanese strains might be different from the strains found in other countries.

While infections are reported in a wide range of avian species, the pathogenicity of chicken-origin virulent NDV isolates in ducks remains elusive. In this study, two NDV strains were isolated and biologically and genetically characterized from an outbreak in chickens and apparently healthy ducks. Pathogenicity assessment indices, including the mean death time (MDT), intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and cleavage motifs in the fusion (F) protein, indicated that both isolates were velogenic in nature. While these isolates carried pathogenic characteristics, interestingly they showed differential pathogenicity in ducks. The chicken-origin isolate caused high (70%) mortality, whereas the duck-origin virus resulted in low (20%) mortality in 4-week-old ducks. Intriguingly, both isolates showed comparable disease pathologies in chickens. Full-genome sequence analysis showed that the virus genome contains 15Â 192 nucleotides and carried features that are characteristic of velogenic strains of NDV. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that both isolates clustered in class II and genotype VII. However, there were several mutations in the functionally important regions of the fusion (F) and haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins, which may be responsible for the differential pathogenicity of these viruses in ducks. In summary, these results suggest that NDV strains with the same genotype show differential pathogenicity in chickens and ducks. Furthermore, chicken-origin virulent NDVs are more pathogenic for ducks than duck-origin viruses. These findings propose a role for chickens in the evolution of viral pathogenicity and the potential genetic resistance of ducks to poultry viruses."

In order to assess the epidemic state of avian leukosis virus in indigenous chickens in China, 10 novel strains of ALV subgroup J (ALV-J), named JS16JH01 to JS16JH10, were isolated and identified by virus isolation and immunofluorescence antibody assays from a Chinese local breed farm with a sporadic incidence of tumors. To understand their virological characteristics further, the proviral genome of ENV-LTR was sequenced and compared with the reference strains. The homology of the gp85 gene between the ten ALV-J strains and NX0101 was in the range from 89.7-94.8% at the nuclear acid level. In addition, their gp85 genes were quite varied, with identities of 92-98% with themselves at the nuclear acid level. There were several snp and indel sites in the amino acid sequence of gp85 genes after comparison with other reference strains of ALV. Interestingly, a novel insertion in the gp85 region was found in two strains, JS16JH01 and JS16JH07, compared with NX0101 and HPRS-103. At present, owing to the large-scale purification of ALV in China, laying hens and broiler chickens with ALV infection are rarely detected, but ALVs are still frequently detected in the local chickens, which suggests that more efforts should be applied to the purification of ALV from indigenous chickens."

Seven strains of velogenic Newcastle disease virus were isolated from poultry and other avian species in central and northern Mexico from 1998 to 2006 and subjected to phylogenetic analysis and biological characterization using standard pathogenicity tests and challenge studies. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all velogenic strains belonged to genetic group V and are clearly divided in two lineages, since phylogenetic similarities between groups are of only 93-94%. Isolates from 1998 to 2001 are closely related to the strain responsible for the 2000 year outbreak raised in La Laguna region (Torreon strain), and are phylogenetically distinct from viruses isolated between 2004 and 2006 that are genetically related to the Chimalhuacan strain isolated in 1973. All the viruses of both, the Chimalhuacan and the Torreon groups, contained a virulent fusion protein cleavage site represented by the motif ""GGRRQKRF"", revealing that evolutionary changes occurred at a different site. Chicken embryo mean death time value was shorter for the Chimalhuacan-like viruses (43.9 hours), when compared with the 1998-2001 average (54.3 hours). ICPI average value was higher (1.92) for viruses isolated during 2004-2006 than that for viruses isolated before 2001 (1.74). Microscopic evaluation of bursa of Fabricius and thymus of 5w-o broiler chickens challenged with 10â¶ LDââ/0.2 ml showed that Chimalhuacan-like isolate caused more severe lesions at 48 hpi in bursa and 72 and 96 hpi in thymus than Torreon-like isolate. Along with the MDT, ICPI and microscopic results, our findings suggest that some distinct selective pressure on the very virulent Chimalhuacan strain isolated in early 1970's may have led to the appearance of the still velogenic but less virulent new group (Torreon-like) in the middle of 1990's."

The development of filters made of porcelain or kieselgur by the end of the 19th century which withheld bacteria allowed the identification of infectious agents smaller than bacteria and noncultivable on the media known at that time and used to grow bacteria. Even finer-grain filters resulted in the observation that the ultravisible novel infectious agents are in fact of particulate nature. Infections of plants and animals were the first to be attributed to these tiny entities. Proof resulted from experimental infection of the natural hosts (including humans). Thus, of the first 30 viruses identified, 20 are veterinary viruses, i.e. infectious agents of poultry and livestock. The discovery that bacteria also have viruses in the 1910s expanded the viral universe which continues today. Filterability and ultravisibility remained a hallmark for the identification of viruses until the advent of the electron microscope in the late 1930s marking another technological breakthrough in virology. Cell culture techniques allowed virus propagation outside the infected organism. In the past decades, the advent and development of molecular biology has brought more innovations culminating in the rapid and accurate determination of genomic material of a variety of living beings including viruses in a hitherto unknown speed and depth using next-generation sequencing and metagenomic analyses. Thus, it is no surprise that new viruses are detected constantly including specimens of unprecedented size and shape. Virologists agree that the viral universe is immense, and only a small fraction has been explored yet."

ORFs 2 to 7 were cloned in plasmids downstream of the Sp6 RNA polymerase promoter, and the translation of transcripts generated in vitro yielded proteins that could be immunoprecipitated with porcine anti-LV serum. Synthetic polypeptides of 15 to 17 amino acids were selected from the amino acid sequences of ORFs 2 to 7 and antipeptide sera were raised in rabbits. Antisera that immunoprecipitated the in vitro translation products of ORFs 2 to 5 and 7 were obtained. Sera containing antibodies directed against peptides from ORFs 3 to 7 reacted positively with LV-infected alveolar lung macrophages in the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. Using these antipeptide sera and porcine anti-LV serum, we identified three structural proteins and assigned their corresponding genes. Virions were found to contain a nucleocapsid protein of 15 kDa (N), an unglycosylated membrane protein of 18 kDa (M), and a glycosylated membrane protein of 25 kDa (E). The N protein is encoded by ORF7, the M protein is encoded by ORF6, and the E protein is encoded by ORF5. The E protein in virus particles contains one or two N-glycans that are resistant to endo-beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase H. This finding indicates that the high-mannose glycans are processed into complex glycans in the Golgi compartment. The protein composition of the LV virions further confirms that LV is evolutionarily related to equine arteritis virus, simian hemorrhagic fever virus, and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus."

More detailed comparison of the isolates by restriction endonuclease mapping using HindIII and XhoI demonstrated a close relationship between all isolates and confirmed them as cowpox viruses. However, some minor differences between the isolates were detected which proved to be of epidemiological value. One group consisting of five closely related isolates contained a unique 4.0 kb HindIII fragment.

It was first described in Kenya in 1921 and since then many isolates have been collected worldwide. However, although several phylogenetic studies have been carried out to understand the relationships between the isolates, no molecular dating analyses have been achieved so far. In this paper, comprehensive phylogenetic reconstructions were made using newly generated, publicly available sequences of hundreds of ASFV isolates from the past 70 years. Analyses focused on B646L, CP204L, and E183L genes from 356, 251, and 123 isolates, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses were achieved using maximum likelihood and Bayesian coalescence methods. A new lineage-based nomenclature is proposed to designate 35 different clusters. In addition, dating of ASFV origin was carried out from the molecular data sets. To avoid bias, diversity due to positive selection or recombination events was neutralized. The molecular clock analyses revealed that ASFV strains currently circulating have evolved over 300 years, with a time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in the early 18(th) century."

Although these viruses have been cultured multiple times from cattle egrets, seabirds, and their ticks, efforts to classify them taxonomically using conventional serological and electron microscopic approaches have failed completely. We used a random shotgun sequencing strategy to define the genomes of NYMV and MIDWV. Contigs of 11,631 and 11,752 nucleotides, representing the complete genome of NYMV and the near-complete genome of MIDWV, respectively, were assembled. Each virus genome was predicted to carry six open reading frames (ORFs). BLAST analysis indicated that only two of the ORF proteins of each virus, the putative nucleocapsid and polymerase, had detectable sequence similarity to known viral proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of these ORF proteins demonstrated that the closest relatives of NYNV and MIDWV are negative-stranded-RNA viruses in the order Mononegavirales. On the basis of their very limited sequence similarity to known viruses, we propose that NYMV and MIDWV define a novel genus, Nyavirus, in this order."

After a 2-year hiatus following the initial announcement, the first devices have been released as part of an early access program. We explore the performance of this platform by resequencing the lambda phage genome, and amplicons from a snake venom gland transcriptome. Although the handheld MinION sequencer can generate more than 150 megabases of raw data in one run, at most a quarter of the resulting reads map to the reference, with less than average 10% identity. Much of the sequence consists of insertion/deletion errors, or is seemingly without similarity to the template. Using the lambda phage data as an example, although the reads are long, averaging 5 kb, at best 890 Â± 1932 bases per mapped read could be matched to the reference without soft clipping. In the course of a 36 h run on the MinION, it was possible to resequence the 48 kb lambda phage reference at 16Ã coverage. Currently, substantially larger projects would not be feasible using the MinION. Without increases in accuracy, which would be required for applications such as genome scaffolding and phasing, the current utility of the MinION appears limited. Library preparation requires access to a molecular laboratory, and is of similar complexity and cost to that of other next-generation sequencing platforms. The MinION is an exciting step in a new direction for single-molecule sequencing, though it will require dramatic decreases in error rates before it lives up to its promise."

The emergence of new virulent genotypes from global epizootics and the year-to-year changes observed in the genomic sequence of NDV of low and high virulence implies that distinct genotypes of NDV are simultaneously evolving at different geographic locations across the globe. This vast genomic diversity may be favored by the large variety of avian species susceptible to NDV infection and by the availability of highly mobile wild bird reservoirs. The genomic diversity of NDV increases the possibility of diagnostic failures, resulting in unidentified infections. Constant epidemiological surveillance and pro-active characterization of circulating strains are needed to ensure that the immunological and PCR reagents are effective in identifying NDV circulating worldwide. For example, in the United States, the widely used real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) matrix gene assay for the identification of NDV often fails to detect low virulence APMV-1 from waterfowl, while the RRT-PCR fusion gene assay, used to identify virulent isolates, often fails to detect certain virulent NDV genotypes. A new matrix-polymerase multiplex test that detects most of the viruses currently circulating worldwide and a modified fusion test for the identification of virulent pigeon viruses circulating in the U.S. and Europe have recently been developed. For newly isolated viruses with unknown sequences, recently developed random priming sequencing methods need to be incorporated into the diagnostic arsenal. In addition, the current system of classifying NDV into genotypes or lineages is inadequate. Here, we review the molecular epidemiology and recent diagnostic problems related to viral evolution of NDV and explain why a new system, based on objective criteria, is needed to categorize genotypes."

Also, the putative viral polymerase has been found to share amino acid homology with reverse transcriptase of retroviruses. Using computer-assisted DNA and protein sequence analyses, we examined the genomes of 13 hepadnavirus isolates (nine human, two duck, one woodchuck, and one ground squirrel) and found that other conserved regions of the hepadnavirus genome share homology to corresponding regions of the genomes of type C retroviruses and retrovirus-like endogenous human DNA elements. Specifically, the most highly conserved sequence of the HBV genome, positioned at or near the initiation site for first-strand HBV DNA synthesis, is homologous over 67 nucleotides to the U5 region, a comparable region in retrovirus long terminal repeats. Within a highly conserved (i.e., 90%) 16-nucleotide sequence a heptanucleotide sequence CCTTGGG is 97% homologous between 27 virus isolates. Also, we found that the highly conserved HBV core, or nucleocapsid, protein shares 41% homology over 98 amino acids with the carboxyl-terminal region of the p30 gag nucleocapsid protein of type C retroviruses. In both cases, as with the previously reported polymerase homology, HBV is most homologous to the murine leukemia/sarcoma retroviruses. Further analysis revealed additional similarities between hepadnavirus and retroviral genomes. Taken together, our results suggest that HBV and retroviruses have a common evolutionary origin, with HBV arising through a process of deletion from a retrovirus, or retrovirus-like, progenitor.</jats:p>"

Only the oânyong-nyong arbovirus (ONNV) is known to be consistently transmitted to vertebrates by Anopheles mosquitoes. A systematic literature review searched four databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Lissa. In addition, online and print resources were searched manually. The searches yielded 259 records. After screening for eligibility criteria, we found at least 51 viruses reported in Anopheles, including viruses with potential to cause febrile disease if transmitted to humans or other vertebrates. Studies to date have not provided evidence that Anopheles consistently transmit and maintain arboviruses other than ONNV. However, anthropophilic Anopheles vectors of malaria are constantly exposed to arboviruses in human bloodmeals. It is possible that in malaria-endemic zones, febrile symptoms may be commonly misdiagnosed. It is also possible that anophelines may be inherently less competent arbovirus vectors than culicines, but if true, the biological basis would warrant further study. This systematic review contributes a context to characterize the biology, knowledge gaps, and potential public health risk of Anopheles viruses.</jats:p>"

            Humans are colonized by immense populations of viruses, which metagenomic analysis shows are mostly unique to each individual. To investigate the origin and evolution of the human gut virome, we analyzed the viral community of one adult individual over 2.5 y by extremely deep metagenomic sequencing (56 billion bases of purified viral sequence from 24 longitudinal fecal samples). After assembly, 478 well-determined contigs could be identified, which are inferred to correspond mostly to previously unstudied bacteriophage genomes. Fully 80% of these types persisted throughout the duration of the 2.5-y study, indicating long-term global stability. Mechanisms of base substitution, rates of accumulation, and the amount of variation varied among viral types. Temperate phages showed relatively lower mutation rates, consistent with replication by accurate bacterial DNA polymerases in the integrated prophage state. In contrast, Microviridae, which are lytic bacteriophages with single-stranded circular DNA genomes, showed high substitution rates (&gt;10

            per nucleotide each day), so that sequence divergence over the 2.5-y period studied approached values sufficient to distinguish new viral species. Longitudinal changes also were associated with diversity-generating retroelements and virus-encoded Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats arrays. We infer that the extreme interpersonal diversity of human gut viruses derives from two sources, persistence of a small portion of the global virome within the gut of each individual and rapid evolution of some long-term virome members.

We determined EV-71 sequences at loci 1D (VP1 capsid protein) and 3CD (non-structural proteins) in 86 strains recovered in Austria, France and Germany and performed an evolutionary genetic study of extant virus populations. Phylogenetic analyses positioned 78 of the 86 sequences within two clades among subgenogroups C1 and C2. A minor sequence cluster was assigned to subgenogroup C4. Analyses incorporating the available sequences estimated the substitution rate in genogroup C at 3.66 x 10(-3) and 4.46 x 10(-3) substitutions per site year(-1) for loci 1D and 3CD, respectively, assuming a relaxed molecular-clock model for sequence evolution. Most of the 'European' strains belonged to clades C1b and C2b, which originated in 1994 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 1992.7-1995.8] and 2002 (95 % CI, 2001.6-2003.8), respectively. Estimates of divergence times for locus 3CD were consistent with those measured for locus 1D. Intertwining between clades representing EV-71 subgenogroups and clades corresponding to other enterovirus types (notably early coxsackievirus A prototype strains) in the 3CD phylogeny is highly indicative of ancestral recombination events. Incongruent phylogenetic patterns estimated for loci 1D and 3CD show that a single tree cannot model the epidemic history of circulating EV-71 populations. The evolutionary timescale of genogroup C estimated for both loci was measured only in decades, indicating recent dissemination."

BVDV is one of the most important viral pathogens of ruminants worldwide, causing severe economic losses. Infection results in a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild respiratory disease to fetal death and mucosal disease. The virus particles are small and contain a singlestranded, positive-sense RNA molecule of approximately 12.3 kb with one large open reading frame flanked by two untranslated regions (5âUTR and 3âUTR). The polyprotein is proteolytically cleaved by viral and host proteases resulting in the formation of mature viral proteins. It is well established that BVDV strains show considerable genetic diversity. BVD viruses are classified as two species: BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. Quite recently, a new putative species, BVDV-3, was detected. The viruses exist as one of two biotypes: cytopathic or non- cytopathic, based on their activity in cell cultures. The phylogenetic analysis of the 5âUTR and N<jats:sup>pro</jats:sup> region has revealed at least 21 distinct subtypes of BVDV-1 and 4 subtypes of BVDV-2.

Nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect BVDV-2 in one of 1561 blood samples collected randomly from 78 sheep flocks in 11 states of India. Antigenic characterization of the isolated pestivirus using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies typed the isolate as BVDV-2. When analyzed at genetic level in N(pro) (N-terminal autoprotease) and entire gene region coding structural proteins, namely capsid (C) protein and envelope proteins E(rns) (ribonuclease secreted), E1 and E2 genomic organization was the same for all pestiviruses, the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences showed highest similarity with those of BVDV-2. When compared with BVDV-2 isolate 890, the sequence homology was 83.7% for C, 84.6% for E(rns) and E1, and 81.5% for E2. The cleavage site C/E(rns) was found totally conserved while N(pro)/C was conserved only from C-terminus of N(pro), E(rns)/E1 site was conserved only from C-terminus of E(rns) and E1/E2 site was conserved only from C-terminus of E1. Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences in 5' untranslated regions (UTR), N(pro), E2, NS3 and NS5B regions placed the sheep isolate in a separate clade within BVDV-2 subtype b. This was supported by the presence of unique mutations in the structural protein coding regions beside NS3 and NS5B. To our knowledge this is the first report on the sequence analysis of the entire structural gene coding region of a BVDV-2b isolate. This is also the first occurrence of BVDV-2 subtype b in sheep, providing the evidence that this subtype can also occur in species other than cattle."

The pathogenesis of BRD is complex and includes contributions from microbial pathogens as well as host, environmental and animal management factors. In this study, we utilized viral metagenomic sequencing to explore the virome of nasal swab samples obtained from feedlot cattle with acute BRD and asymptomatic pen-mates at six and four feedlots in Mexico and the USA, respectively, in April-October 2015. Twenty-one viruses were detected, with bovine rhinitis A (52.7â%) and B (23.7â%) virus, and bovine coronavirus (24.7â%) being the most commonly identified. The emerging influenza D virus (IDV) tended to be significantly associated (P=0.134; odds ratio=2.94) with disease, whereas viruses commonly associated with BRD such as bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine parainfluenza 3 virus were detected less frequently. The detection of IDV was further confirmed using a real-time PCR assay. Nasal swabs from symptomatic animals had significantly more IDV RNA than those collected from healthy animals (P=0.04). In addition to known viruses, new genotypes of bovine rhinitis B virus and enterovirus E were identified and a newly proposed species of bocaparvovirus, Ungulate bocaparvovirus 6, was characterized. Ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 was also detected for the first time in North America to our knowledge. These results illustrate the complexity of the virome associated with BRD and highlight the need for further research into the contribution of other viruses to BRD pathogenesis."

The virus could be detected in 17 of 20 field samples from broiler chickens in Haryana state, India as well as in all the four vaccine strains. Nucleotide sequences of four field isolates and one vaccine strain were compared with 10 reported IBDV strains from different parts of the world. Nucleotide substitutions at 795G, 827T, 833C, 857C, 897A, 905T, 908T, 1011A and 1094G specific for very virulent (vv) strains, were maintained in all the four field isolates. However, unique nucleotide substitutions at 806A-G, 851 C-T, 1010 T-C, 1019T-C and 1082T-C showed further divergence of these isolates from already reported vvIBDVs. Deduced amino acid substitutions at 222P-A, 256V-I, 279N-D, 294L-I and 299N-S specific for vvIBDV strains were also present in all the four isolates. The vaccine strain showed amino acid change 279D-N, a characteristic of attenuated vaccine strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all the field isolates in the present study were closely related to reported UK (UK661) and Japan (OKYM) field isolates. All the four field IBDV strains of the present study were closely related to each other but distinct from already reported vvIBDVs of India. On the basis of nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, it is very likely that IBD causing strains in this part of India are of very virulent character and are still undergoing changes at genetic level."

Since its discovery in 2003, few studies have addressed bovine kobuvirus (BKoV; a species of Aichivirus B) infections. BKoV has been reported in Europe, Asia, and South America, suggesting a worldwide distribution. To investigate the presence of BKoV in Egypt, 36 fecal specimens from diarrheic calves in two different Egyptian provinces (Cairo and Sharkia) were screened by RT-PCR and 24 (66.7%) were found positive for BKoV. RNA from one of the positive samples (BKoV/Egy-1/KY407744) was subjected to next-generation sequencing to determine the complete BKoV genome sequence. When compared to the only recorded BKoV genome sequence (BKoV/U-1/AB084788), the studied strain showed 94 amino acid (aa) substitutions through its entire polyprotein (2463 aa), one nucleotide (nt) insertion and one nt deletion in the 2B gene and 4-nt deletions in the UTRs (2 each). Additionally, five VP1 and seven 3D sequences were obtained from other samples by using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. A discrepancy in the phylogenetic topography of VP1 and 3D was observed, where theÂ Egyptian VP1 sequences were classified as a distinct cluster within the proposed lineage 1 (genotype A), which also contained strains from the UK, Brazil, and Japan. While,Â the 3D sequences from Cairo were related to those of Chinese strains unlikeÂ Sharkia ones thatÂ were moreÂ closer to Korean Â strains.

In this present study, a DNA vaccine containing the F and HN surface antigens of a highly virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV), NDV/1/Chicken/2005 (FJ939313), was successfully generated. Cell transfection test indicated that the vaccine expressed the F and HN genes in Hep-2 cells. The main objective of this study was to compare the extent of protection induced by DNA vaccination after homologous and heterologous NDV-challenge as determined by the amount of NDV shedding after challenge. NDV-antibody-negative chickens were vaccinated either once, twice or thrice intramuscularly at 7, 14 and 21 days old and were challenged 14 days post vaccination with either homologous virus (vaccine-matched velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease virus (vvNDV) strain, FJ939313), phylogenetically related to group VII, or a phylogenetically divergent heterologous virus (unmatched vvNDV strain, AY968809), which belongs to genogroup VI and shows 84.1% nucleotide similarity to the NDV-sequences of the DNA vaccine. Our data indicate that birds, which received a single dose of the DNA vaccine were poorly protected, and only 30-40% of these birds survived after challenge with high virus shedding titre. Multiple administration of the DNA vaccine induced high protection rates of 70-90% with reduced virus shedding compared to the non-vaccinated and challenged birds. Generally, homologous challenge led to reduced tracheal and cloacal shedding compared to the heterologous vvNDV strain. This study provides a promising approach for the control of ND in chickens using DNA vaccines, which are phylogenetically closely related to the circulating field strains."

With dot blot hybridization technique, a cDNA probe derived from genome segment 6 of EHDV-2 (Alberta strain) hybridized with RNA from EHDV-318. Application of serogroup-specific EHDV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to EHDV-318 RNA resulted in specific amplification of a 387 bp PCR product. Amplification product was visualized on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. Specificity of the PCR products was confirmed by chemiluminescent hybridization with a non-radiolabelled internal probe. No amplification product or hybridization signal was detected when the serotype-specific EHDV-1 or EHDV-2 PCR-based assays were applied to RNA from EHDV-318. The scientific data presented in this study indicated that cDNA probes and serogroup-specific PCR-based assay can be used to classify the virus as a member of EHDV serogroup, and as serotypically distinct from EHDV-1 and EHDV-2."

Akin to the 1D region, this deletion group is gradually diverging genetically even at L region forming more number of lineages and inter-lineage distance at L region is considerably more than that for 1D region. The deletion group is restricted to India only as none of the exotic sequences clustered within this group. Notably, L protein exhibited variability comparable to external capsid proteins as evident from its high d(N)/d(S) ratio (0.105), number of variable amino acid positions (41%), low Ts/Tv ratio (3.47) and alignment revealed N-terminal region, beta2 sheet and C-terminal extension to be extremely variable. Basic residues at P1, P3 and only leucine at P2 were predicted to provide an optimum autocatalytic cleavage site at L/P1 junction. All of the eight sites identified to be under positive selection revealed aa substitutions of varied physicochemical properties and at two positions lineage specific signatures were observed, which supports the contention that lineages are evolving under differential selection pressure to adapt to the varied ecological environment."

Based on the high sequence identities (>99%) of the VP6, VP4, VP7, and NSP4 genes among 5 of the studied fecal specimens (BR59-BR63), they are considered the same local rotavirus strain denominated RVH/BRA-1. In contrast, once that the fecal sample BR64 showed a relatively high difference (81.6% nt identity and 83.4% aa identity) in the VP7 sequence when compared to the other 5 specimens it was named RVH/BRA-2 strain. Comparative phylogenetic analysis showed that the 6 RVH strains do not cluster together with any available sequences of members of the established RV groups (RVA-RVG), however, seem to be related to RVB and RVG. These results confirm the presence of RVH in Brazil, demonstrate their genetic diversity, and provide new data that will assist in understanding the viral phylogeny and epidemiology, as well as the explanation of patterns of viral evolution and biological properties of RVH."

The cell line was derived from a bursal lymphoma induced by avian leukosis virus infection. In this study we characterized the genome of the cell line using whole genome shotgun sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism array hybridization. The results indicate that wild-type DT40 has a relatively normal karyotype, except for whole chromosome copy number gains, and no karyotype variability within stocks. In a comparison to two domestic chicken genomes and the Gallus gallus reference genome, we found no unique mutational processes shaping the DT40 genome except for a mild increase in insertion and deletion events, particularly deletions at tandem repeats. We mapped coding sequence mutations that are unique to the DT40 genome; mutations inactivating the PIK3R1 and ATRX genes likely contributed to the oncogenic transformation. In addition to a known avian leukosis virus integration in the MYC gene, we detected further integration sites that are likely to de-regulate gene expression. The new findings support the hypothesis that DT40 is a typical transformed cell line with a relatively intact genome; therefore, it is well-suited to the role of a model system for DNA repair and related processes. The sequence data generated by this study, including a searchable de novo genome assembly and annotated lists of mutated genes, will support future research using this cell line."

Several putative functional domains such as a papain-like proteinase (PL(pro)), main protease (M(pro)), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and RNA helicase encoded by the replicase gene are important for virus replication. We have sequenced four regions of the replicase genes corresponding to the 5'-terminal sequence, PL(pro), M(pro), and RdRp domains from 20 heterologous IBV strains, and compared them with previously published coronavirus sequences. All the coronavirus 5'-termini and PL(pro) domains were divergent, unlike the M(pro) and the RdRp domains that were highly conserved with 28% and 48% conserved residues, respectively. Among IBV strains, the 5' untranslated region including the leader sequence was highly conserved (>94% identical); whereas, the N-terminal coding region and the PL(pro) domains were highly variable ranging from 84.6% to 100%, and 77.6% to 100% identity, respectively. The IBV M(pro) and RdRp domains were highly conserved with 82.7% and 92.7% conserved residues, respectively. The BJ strain was the most different from other IBVs in all four regions of the replicase. Phylogeny-based clustering based on replicase genes was identical to the antigen-based classification of coronaviruses into three groups. However, the IBV strain classification based on replicase gene domains did not correlate with that of the type-specific antigenic groups. The replicase gene sequences of many IBVs recovered from infected chickens were identical to those of vaccine viruses irrespective of serotype, suggesting that either there has been an exchange of genetic material among vaccine and field isolates or that there is a convergent evolution to a specific replicase genotype. There was no correlation between the genotype of any region of the replicase gene and pathotype, suggesting that the replicase is not the sole determinant of IBV pathogenicity."

Thirty-nine lots (53.4%) were positive for pestivirus RNA and one contained infectious virus. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the 5âUTR revealed 34 lots (46.6%) containing RNA of bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 (BVDV-1), being 23 BVDV-1a (5â UTR identity 90.8-98.7%), eight BVDV-1b (93.9-96.7%) and three BVDV-1d (96.2- 97.6%).

New genotypes have been recently identified in various mammals, including HEV genotype 3, which has a worldwide distribution. It is widespread among pigs in developed countries. This study investigated the genetic diversity of HEV among humans and swine in Italy. The date of origin and the demographic history of the HEV were also estimated. A total of 327 HEV sequences of swine and humans from Italy were downloaded from the national centre for biotechnology information. Three different data sets were constructed. The first and the second data set were used to confirm the genotype of the sequences analyzed. The third data set was used to estimate the mean evolutionary rate and to determine the time-scaled phylogeny and demographic history. The Bayesian maximum clade credibility tree and the time of the most common recent ancestor estimates showed that the root of the tree dated back to the year 1907 (95% HPD: 1811 - 1975). Two main clades were found, divided into two subclades. Skyline plot analysis, performed separately for human and swine sequences, demonstrated the presence of a bottleneck only in the skyline plot from the swine sequences. Selective pressure analysis revealed only negatively selected sites. This study provides support for the hypothesis that humans are probably infected after contact with swine sources. The findings emphasize the importance of checking the country of origin of swine and of improving sanitary control measures from the veterinary standpoint to prevent the spread of HEV infection in Italy."

S1 amino acid sequences of the California variants, CV-56b, CV-9437, and CV-1686, were 97.6-99.3% similar to one another and only 76.6%-76.8% similar to the Arkansas-type strains. Isolate 1013, also from California, was 84.0% similar to Ark DPI and 77.9% similar to CV-56b. When comparing 19 viruses isolated from the United States, sequence variations were observed between amino acids 55-96, 115-149, 255-309, and 378-395. Similar regions are reported to be involved in virus-neutralizing and/or serotype-specific epitopes. These data demonstrate that variant IBV strains continue to emerge, and unique variants may circulate among poultry in geographically isolated areas."

All of the 12 isolates showed similar sequences at the cleavage site, RSSF/GLF, bearing eight potential glycosylation sites and sharing the characteristic deduced amino acid residues alanine-190, glutamine-226, and glutamine-227 at the receptor-binding site. Ten out of these 12 isolates possessed leucine at position 226, which prevails in the sequences found in human H2 and H3 strains. Overall, the presence in these Iranian poultry H9N2 viruses of the sequence known to bind to human-type receptors and the presence of antibodies in the human population of Iran to H9N2 showed that it is possible for circulating H9N2 avian influenza viruses in Iran to infect humans. Hence, extensive surveillance of H9N2 in this country is highly recommended."

The current study was conducted for the detection and molecular characterization of astroviruses in diarrheic pigs submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, University of Minnesota. Intestinal contents from 269 pigs were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and 62% were found positive for astroviruses. Of the positive samples, 20% were positive for astrovirus alone while astrovirus with rotavirus was detected in 58% of the samples. The remaining 22% revealed the presence of astrovirus along with Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, Transmissible gastroenteritis virus, or Porcine circovirus-2. Sequencing the capsid gene of 56 randomly selected samples confirmed them to be Porcine astrovirus type 4 (PAstV-4) with 58-100% nucleotide identity within these viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 2 possible subgroups. The results indicate that PAstV is present on swine farms in the United States and that it may be associated with diarrhea either alone or in combination with other enteric viruses. Further studies are needed to determine strain diversity among porcine astroviruses so that appropriate control strategies can be devised and implemented."

All three L class gene segments of TARVs and TERVs and their encoded proteins Î»A, Î»B, and Î»C were similar in size to those of CRV reference strain S1133. The conserved motifs such as C2H2 zinc-binding motif and conserved polymerase region were present in Î»A and Î»B, respectively. A conserved motif for ATP/GTP-binding site and an S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-binding pocket for methyltransferase were observed in Î»C protein of TARVs and TERVs with only one substitution as compared to that in CRV. We propose a new genotype classification system for avian reoviruses (ARVs) based on the nt identity cut-off value for each of the L class. Based on this new genotype classification, all ARVs were divided into six, seven and eight genotypes in L1, L2 and L3 genes, respectively. Interestingly TARVs and TERVs grouped with three CRVs (two arthritic strains from Taiwan and one enteritic strain from Japan) in genotype L1-I and formed a different genotypes (L2-I, L3-I) from CRVs in L2 and L3 genes. The maximum nucleotide divergence was observed in genotypes of L1 and L2 genes but less at amino acid level indicates mostly changes were synonymous type. Compared to L1 and L2 genes, the nonsynonymous changes were more in L3 gene. Point mutations and possible reassortments among TARVs, TERVs and CRVs were also observed."

Single-locus typing has previously shown differentiation between Atlantic and Pacific strains of this virus, with low variation within each geographic clade. However, a lack of multi-locus genomic sequence data hinders understanding of the rate and mechanisms of ChHV5 evolutionary divergence, as well as how these genomic changes may contribute to differences in disease manifestation. To assess genomic variation in ChHV5 among five Hawaii and three Florida green sea turtles, we used high-throughput short-read sequencing of long-range PCR products amplified from tumor tissue using primers designed from the single available ChHV5 reference genome from a Hawaii green sea turtle. This strategy recovered sequence data from both geographic regions for approximately 75% of the predicted ChHV5 coding sequences. The average nucleotide divergence between geographic populations was 1.5%; most of the substitutions were fixed differences between regions. Protein divergence was generally low (average 0.08%), and ranged between 0 and 5.3%. Several atypical genes originally identified and annotated in the reference genome were confirmed in ChHV5 genomes from both geographic locations. Unambiguous recombination events between geographic regions were identified, and clustering of private alleles suggests the prevalence of recombination in the evolutionary history of ChHV5. This study significantly increased the amount of sequence data available from ChHV5 strains, enabling informed selection of loci for future population genetic and natural history studies, and suggesting the (possibly latent) co-infection of individuals by well-differentiated geographic variants.</jats:p>"

The analysis of function, however, lags behind. In both the<jats:italic>cis</jats:italic>- and<jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>-regulatory functions of RNA, secondary structure (2D base-pairing) plays essential regulatory roles. In order to test RNA function, it is essential to be able to design and analyze mutations that can affect structure. This was the motivation for the creation of the RNA2DMut web tool. With RNA2DMut, users can enter in RNA sequences to analyze, constrain mutations to specific residues, or limit changes to purines/pyrimidines. The sequence is analyzed at each base to determine the effect of every possible point mutation on 2D structure. The metrics used in RNA2DMut rely on the calculation of the Boltzmann structure ensemble and do not require a robust 2D model of RNA structure for designing mutations. This tool can facilitate a wide array of uses involving RNA: for example, in designing and evaluating mutants for biological assays, interrogating RNAâprotein interactions, identifying key regions to alter in SELEX experiments, and improving RNA folding and crystallization properties for structural biology. Additional tools are available to help users introduce other mutations (e.g., indels and substitutions) and evaluate their effects on RNA structure. Example calculations are shown for five RNAs that require 2D structure for their function: the MALAT1 mascRNA, an influenza virus splicing regulatory motif, the EBER2 viral noncoding RNA, the Xist lncRNA repA region, and human Y RNA 5.

Unbiased high-throughput sequencing using the 318 v2 semiconductor chip of these eight samples yielded 57-580 K (average: 270 K, after data analysis) reads in a single run. As a result, viral genome sequences were detected in each specimen.

We describe here acute hepatitis E in three immunocompromized children. Case no. 1 was a 9-year-old liver transplant recipient girl in whom H1N1 2009 flu infection was diagnosed concurrently with hepatitis E. Case no. 2 was a 12-year-old boy presenting early medullar relapse of lymphoblastic leukemia of type B and in whom HEV RNA was detected over a 29-week period. Case no. 3 was a 9-year-old boy with a rare primary immunodeficiency due to XIAP deficiency. HEV infections were all autochthonously acquired and involved different viruses classified as subtype f, c, and e of genotype 3, which are those described in autochthonous cases in Europe. These three observations prompt to consider HEV as a causative agent of hepatitis in children in developed countries, and to perform particularly HEV testing in those severely immunocompromized who may develop chronic hepatitis E."

The aim of the study was to estimate in population of free-living wild boar in the Czech Republic the prevalence of enteric viral pathogens, namely rotavirus groups A and C (RVA and RVC), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and members of family Coronaviridae (transmissible gastroenteritis virus - TGEV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus - PEDV, porcine respiratory coronavirus - PRCV, and porcine hemagglutination encephalomyelitis virus - PHEV) and Picornaviridae,(teschovirus A - PTV, sapelovirus A - PSV, and enterovirus G - EV-G). In our study, stool samples from 203 wild boars culled during hunting season 2014-2015 (from October to January) were examined by RT-PCR. RVA was detected in 2.5% of tested samples. Nucleotide analysis of VP7, VP4, and VP6 genes revealed that four RVA strains belong to G4P[25]I1, G4P[6]I5, G11P[13]I5, and G5P[13]I5 genotypes and phylogenetic analysis suggested close relation to porcine and human RVAs. The prevalence of RVC in wild boar population reached 12.8%, PTV was detected in 20.2%, PSV in 8.9%, and EV-G in 2.5% of samples. During our study no PRRSV or coronaviruses were detected. Our study provides the first evidence of RVC prevalence in wild boars and indicates that wild boars might contribute to the genetic variability of RVA and also serve as an important reservoir of other enteric viruses."

Through RNAi screening, we identify an evolutionarily conserved and interferon-independent role for the DEAD-box helicase DDX17 in restricting Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a mosquito-transmitted virus in the bunyavirus family that causes severe morbidity and mortality in humans and livestock. Loss of Drosophila DDX17 (Rm62) in cells and flies enhanced RVFV infection. Similarly, depletion of DDX17 but not the related helicase DDX5 increased RVFV replication in human cells. Using crosslinking immunoprecipitation high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq), we show that DDX17 binds the stem loops of host pri-miRNA to facilitate their processing and also an essential stem loop in bunyaviral RNA to restrict infection. Thus, DDX17 has dual roles in the recognition of stem loops: in the nucleus for endogenous microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and in the cytoplasm for surveillance against structured non-self-elements."

We propose a definition of 'molecular surveillance' in this context and argue that molecular data are an adjunct to rather than a substitute for sound epidemiological study and surveillance design. Specific considerations with regard to sample collection are raised, as is the importance of the relation between the molecular clock speed of genetic markers and the spatiotemporal scale of the surveillance activity, which can be control- or strategy-focused.

In this study, the lineage of rabies virus (RABV) in Zambia was determined by phylogenetic analysis of the nucleoprotein (N) and glycoprotein (G) gene sequences. Total RNA was extracted from 87-DFAT brain specimens out of which only 35 (40%) were positive on nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for each gene, and 26 being positive for both genes. Positive specimens for the N (n=33) and G (n=35) genes were used for phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of the N gene showed two phylogenetic clusters in Zambia belonging to the Africa 1b lineage present in eastern and southern Africa. While one cluster exclusively comprised Zambian strains, the other was more heterogeneous regarding the RABV origins and included strains from Tanzania, Mozambique and Zambia. Phylogenetic analysis of the G gene revealed similar RABV strains in different hosts and regions of Zambia. We designed primers for reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay from the consensus sequence of the N gene in an attempt to improve the molecular diagnosis of RABV in Zambia. The specificity and reproducibility of the RT-LAMP assay was confirmed with actual clinical specimens. Therefore, the RT-LAMP assay presented in this study may prove to be useful for routine diagnosis of rabies in Zambia."

In addition, the results reveal transcriptional silencing of cytoskeletal proteins such as the alpha, beta, and gamma types of actin, and a downregulation of the thioredoxin gene, a likely mediator of apoptosis with possible implications in NDV pathogenesis. Comparative analyses show that a majority of genes that were transcriptionally regulated during infection with another common respiratory pathogen of poultry, the avian pneumovirus, remained unaltered during NDV infection, suggesting that even phylogenetically related viruses elicit unique or ""signature"" patterns of host transcriptional profiles during infection of host cells."

The animals, six weeks old and clinically healthy, were inoculated with the virulent strain Margarita (secondary virus). For exclusive detection of the Margarita strain, a specific qRT-PCR assay was designed, which proved not to have cross-reactivity with the Cat01 strain. The wild boars persistently infected with CSFV were protected from superinfection by the virulent CSFV Margarita strain, as evidenced by the absence of clinical signs and the absence of Margarita RNA detection in serum, swabs and tissue samples. Additionally, in PBMCs, a well-known target for CSFV viral replication, only the primary infecting virus RNA (Cat01 strain) could be detected, even after the isolation in ST cells, demonstrating SIE at the tissue level in vivo. Furthermore, the data analysis of the Margarita qRT-PCR, by means of calculated ÎCt values, supported that PBMCs from persistently infected animals were substantially protected from superinfection after in vitro inoculation with the Margarita virus strain, while this virus was able to infect naive PBMCs efficiently. In parallel, IFN-Î± values were undetectable in the sera from animals in Group B after inoculation with the CSFV Margarita strain. Furthermore, these animals were unable to elicit adaptive humoral (no E2-specific or neutralising antibodies) or cellular immune responses (in terms of IFN-Î³-producing cells) after inoculation with the second virus. Finally, a sequence analysis could not detect CSFV Margarita RNA in the samples tested from Group B. Our results suggested that the SIE phenomenon might be involved in the evolution and phylogeny of the virus, as well as in CSFV control by vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this study was one of the first showing efficient suppression of superinfection in animals, especially in the absence of IFN-Î±, which might be associated with the lack of innate immune mechanisms."

In the present study, we report the complete nucleotide sequence of this virus (TTV) isolated from the serum of a West African. Based on PCR studies designed to amplify overlapping regions of the viral genome and sensitivity to digestion with mung bean nuclease, the viral genome is circular and negative stranded, and comprises 3,852 nt, which is 113 nt longer than the prototype isolate from Japan. Cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation demonstrated banding of the virus at 1.31-1.34 g/ml; filtration studies indicated that TTV had a particle size of 30-50 nm. These results suggest that the virus is similar to the Circoviridae, viruses known to infect plants and vertebrates (e. g., birds and swine); however, sequence similarity searches of available databases did not reveal identity between TTV and other viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of a 260-nt region from 151 globally distributed isolates demonstrated the existence of three major TTV genotypes. Several individuals at high risk for infection with parenterally transmitted viruses were infected with more than one genotype. There was no correlation between genotype and geographic origin. Finally, intravenous inoculation of TTV-positive human serum into chimpanzees demonstrated that TTV can be transmitted to primates; no biochemical or histological evidence for hepatitis was obtained. The distinct biophysical and molecular characteristics of TTV suggest that it is a member of a new family of viruses, which we have tentatively named the Circinoviridae."

From September 2010 to September 2011, a wild bird surveillance study was conducted in these regions to identify avian influenza viruses. Biological samples consisting of cloacal and tracheal swabs and fecal samples were collected from wild birds of different ecological groups, including waterfowl and sea- and land-based birds, in places of mass bird accumulations in Sivash Bay and the Utlyuksky and Molochniy estuaries. The sampling covered the following wild bird biological cycles: autumn migration, wintering, spring migration, nesting, and postnesting seasons. A total of 3634 samples were collected from 66 different species of birds. During the autumn migration, 19 hemagglutinating viruses were isolated, 14 of which were identified as low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus subtypes H1N?, H3N8, H5N2, H7N?, H8N4, H10N7, and H11N8. From the wintering samples, 45 hemagglutinating viruses were isolated, 36 of which were identified as LPAI virus subtypes H1N1, H1N?

Only three viruses were isolated during the spring migration, nesting, and postnesting seasons (serotypes H6, H13, and H16). The HA and NA genes were sequenced from the isolated H5 and N1 viruses, and the phylogenetic analysis revealed possible ecological connections between the Azov and Black Sea regions and Europe. The LPAI viruses were isolated mostly from mallard ducks, but also from shellducks, shovelers, teals, and white-fronted geese. The rest of the 14 hemagglutinating viruses isolated were identified as different serotypes of avian paramyxoviruses (APMV-1, APMV-4, APMV-6, and APMV-7). This information furthers our understanding of the ecology of avian influenza viruses in wild bird species."

In North America and Europe, HEV has been increasingly detected in swine, and exposure to pigs and pork products is considered to be the primary source of infection. Therefore we set out to investigate the prevalence of HEV in retail pork products available in Canada, by screening meal-size portions of pork pÃ¢tÃ©s, raw pork sausages, and raw pork livers. The presence of the HEV genomes was determined by RT-PCR and viral RNA was quantified by digital droplet PCR. Overall, HEV was detected in 47% of the sampled pork pÃ¢tÃ©s and 10.5% of the sampled raw pork livers, but not in the sampled pork sausages, and sequencing confirmed that all HEV strains belonged to genotype 3. Further phylogenetic analysis revealed that except for one isolate that clusters with subtype 3d, all isolates belong to subtype 3a. Amino acid variations between the isolates were also observed in the sequenced capsid region. In conclusion, the prevalence of HEV in pÃ¢tÃ©s and raw pork livers observed in this study is in agreement with the current HEV distribution in pork products reported in other developed countries."

With the emergence of novel coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, the need for fast genome characterisation is ever so important. Further, in order to understand the influence of quasispecies of these viruses in relation to biology, techniques for deep-sequence and full-length viral genome analysis are needed. In the present study, we compared the efficiency of two sequence-independent approaches [sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and single primer isothermal amplification (SPIA, represented by the Ovation kit)] coupled with high-throughput sequencing to generate the full-length genome of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) from a nasal swab. Both methods achieved high genome coverage (100% for SPIA and 99% for SISPA), however, there was a clear difference in the percentage of reads that mapped to BCoV. While approximately 45% of the Ovation reads mapped to BCoV (sequence depth of 169-284 944), only 0.07% of the SISPA reads (sequence depth of 0-249) mapped to the reference genome. Although BCoV was the focus of the study we also identified a bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) in the data sets. The trend for this virus was similar to that observed for BCoV regarding Ovation vs. SISPA, but with fewer sequences mapping to BRBV due to a lower amount of this virus. In summary, the SPIA approach used in this study produced coverage of the entire BCoV (high copy number) and BRBV (low copy number) and a high sequence/genome depth compared to SISPA. Although this is a limited study, the results indicate that the Ovation method could be a preferred approach for full genome sequencing if a low copy number of viral RNA is expected and if high sequence depth is desired."

Japanese BVDVs were segregated into BVDV1 subdivided into six subgroups and BVDV2. One isolate, So CP/75, isolated in 1975 and previously proposed as subgroup 1e according to its 5'NCR sequence, was quite unique and formed an independent lineage in the tree of any region. Another isolate, 190CP, obtained from an experimental mucosal disease case was classified as subgroup 1e, defined by Becher et al. in the 5'NCR, N(pro) and E2 regions, whereas it was classified as subgroup 1a in the NS5B-3'NCR region. The genomic sequences of the American isolates ILLC and ILLNC obtained from the GenBank database were assigned into subgroup 1b in the 5'NCR, N(pro), E2 and NS5B-3'NCR regions, whereas they were assigned into subgroup 1a in the NS3 region, suggesting that recombination between the virus strains classified into different subgroups had occurred in an animal.

Serological properties were also characterized by the cross-neutralization test using antisera against the representative strain of the classified genotype. Using phylogenetic tree analysis, BVDV 1 was subdivided into two major clusters, BVDV-1a (29 isolates) and BVDV-1b (27 isolates). In group 1a, 3 differed from the other viruses, and were classified in a branch assigned as 1a'. However, 4 isolates (So CP/75, 190 CP, 190 NCP and KS86-1-NCP) could not be assigned to group 1a or 1b. In comparison with the published sequence data, KS86-1-NCP, 190 CP and 190 NCP were similar to the Southern Africa isolates that have recently been proposed as BVDV 1c. The 5' UTR sequence of So CP/75 was unique among those of BVDV 1, suggesting that the isolate should be classified into a new genotype. Only 2 out of 62 isolates collected in 1989 and 1990 were identified as BVDV 2. The results of the cross-neutralization test strongly supported these data, suggesting a close correlation between the 5' UTR sequence and the antigenicity of BVDV."

Of the different viral pathogens detected, read counts gave nearly complete astrovirus-related RNA sequences in 15 of the 146 fecal samples collected in three distinct areas (Hokkaido, Ishikawa, and Kagoshima Prefectures) between 2009 and 2015. Due to the lack of genetic information about bovine astroviruses (BoAstVs) in Japan, these sequences were analyzed in this study. Nine of the 15 Japanese BoAstVs were closely related to Chinese BoAstVs and clustered into a lineage (tentatively named lineage 1) in all phylogenetic trees. Three of 15 strains were phylogenetically separate from lineage 1, showing low sequence identities, and clustered instead with an American strain isolated from cattle with respiratory disease (tentatively named lineage 2). Interestingly, two of 15 strains clustered with lineage 1 in the open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b regions, while they clustered with lineage 2 in the ORF2 region. Remarkably, one of 15 strains exhibited low amino acid sequence similarity to other BoAstVs and was clustered separately with porcine astrovirus type 5 in all trees, and ovine astrovirus in the ORF2 region, suggesting past interspecies transmission."

While advances in sequencing have led to an explosion in the number of whole-genome sequences that are available, an understanding of the rate and distribution of reassortments and their role in viral evolution is still lacking. An important factor in this is the paucity of automated tools for confident identification of reassortments from sequence data due to the challenges of analyzing large, uncertain viral phylogenies. We describe here a novel computational method, called GiRaF (Graph-incompatibility-based Reassortment Finder), that robustly identifies reassortments in a fully automated fashion while accounting for uncertainties in the inferred phylogenies. The algorithms behind GiRaF search large collections of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-sampled trees for groups of incompatible splits using a fast biclique enumeration algorithm coupled with several statistical tests to identify sets of taxa with differential phylogenetic placement. GiRaF correctly finds known reassortments in human, avian, and swine influenza populations, including the evolutionary events that led to the recent 'swine flu' outbreak. GiRaF also identifies several previously unreported reassortments via whole-genome studies to catalog events in H5N1 and swine influenza isolates."

However, to date only the gs/GD H5 lineage had an impact on human health. Rapid and specific diagnosis marks the cornerstone for control and eradication of HPAI virus incursions. We present the development and validation of five real-time RT-PCR assays (RT-qPCR) that allow sequencing-independent pathotype and clade-specific distinction of major gs/GD HPAI H5 virus clades and of Eurasian LPAI viruses currently circulating.

Although the placenta serves the same function in all placental mammals, env-derived genes responsible for trophoblast cell fusion and maternal immune tolerance differ among species and remain largely unidentified in the bovine species. To examine env-derived genes playing a role in the bovine placental development comprehensively, we determined the transcriptomic profiles of bovine conceptuses during three crucial windows of implantation periods using a high-throughput sequencer. The sequence reads were mapped into the bovine genome, in which ERV candidates were annotated using RetroTector(Â©) (7,624 and 1,542 for ERV-derived and env-derived genes, respectively). The mapped reads showed that approximately 18% (284 genes) of env-derived genes in the genome were expressed during placenta formation, and approximately 4% (63 genes) were detected for all days examined. We verified three env-derived genes that are expressed in trophoblast cells by polymerase chain reaction. Out of these three, the sequence of env-derived gene with the longest open reading frame (named BERV-P env) was found to show high expression levels in trophoblast cell lines and to be similar to those of syncytin-Car1 genes found in dogs and cats, despite their disparate origins. These results suggest that placentation depends on various retrovirus-derived genes that could have replaced endogenous predecessors during evolution."

Among 144 serum samples of wild boars captured in Mie prefecture, 7 were positive for HEV-RNA. The nucleotide sequence of nearly the entire genome was determined for 4 of the 7 positive samples. Phylogenetic tree analyses indicated that 6 samples were subtype 3e and 1 was subtype 3a among the 7 isolates. We identified the indigenization of subtype 3e isolates in Japanese wild boars. Furthermore, 5 subtype 3e isolates were closely related and were located in the peripheral branch of subtype 3e isolates from European countries in the phylogenetic tree. The structure indicated that the ancestor of the 5 subtype 3e isolates originated in Europe. The phylogenetic structure and coalescent analyses suggested that the subtype 3e isolates entered Japan from Europe by importation of large-race pigs around 1966. The results also indicated that several lineages of subtype 3e expanded to a wide area of Japan around 1992 and 1 of the lineages was indigenized in wild boars in Mie prefecture between 1992 and 2009. The appearance of a wild boar cluster in the peripheral branch in the phylogenetic lineage may indicate the direction of gene flow of HEV subtype 3e from swine to wild boars.

Mutations introduced into ERVs halt the production of infectious agents, but their effects on the function of retroviral proteins are not fully understood. Retroviral envelope glycoproteins (Envs) are utilized in membrane fusion during viral entry, and we recently identified intact coding sequences for bovine endogenous retrovirus K1 (BERV-K1) and BERV-K2 Envs. Amino acid sequences of BERV-K1 Env (also called Fematrin-1) and BERV-K2 Env are similar, and both viruses are classified in the genus Betaretrovirus. While Fematrin-1 plays an important role in cell-to-cell fusion in bovine placenta, the BERV-K2 envelope gene is marginally expressed in vivo, and its recombinant Env protein is defective in membrane fusion due to inefficient cleavage of surface (SU) and transmembrane subunits. Here, we conducted chimeric analyses of Fematrin-1 and BERV-K2 Envs and revealed that defective maturation of BERV-K2 Env contributed to failed intracellular trafficking. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis suggested that in contrast to Fematrin-1 Env, BERV-K2 Env could not be transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the trans-Golgi network, where cellular proteases required for processing retroviral Envs are localized. We also identified that one of the responsive regions of this phenomenon resided within a 65-amino-acid region of BERV-K2 SU. This is the first report to identify that retroviral Env SU is involved in the regulation of intracellular trafficking, and it may help to elucidate the maturation process of Fematrin-1 and other related Envs. Retroviruses utilize envelope glycoproteins (Envs) to enter host target cells. Mature retroviral Env is a heterodimer, which consists of surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) subunits that are generated by the cleavage of an Env precursor protein in the trans-Golgi network. SU and TM mediate the recognition of the entry receptor and virus-host membrane fusion, respectively. However, unexplained issues remain for the maturation process of retroviral Env. We previously reported that bovine endogenous retrovirus K2 (BERV-K2) Env lost fusogenicity due to a defect in the cleavage of SU and TM. In this study, we identified that mutations residing in BERV-K2 SU disturbed intracellular trafficking of BERV-K2 Env and resulted its inefficient cleavage. Because SU is not known to play an important role in this process, our study may provide novel insights into the maturation mechanism of retroviral Envs."

          <jats:p>Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses with H5 and H7 hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes evolve from low-pathogenic precursors through the acquisition of multiple basic amino acid residues at the HA cleavage site. Although this mechanism has been observed to occur naturally only in these HA subtypes, little is known about the genetic basis for the acquisition of the polybasic HA cleavage site. Here we show that consecutive adenine residues and a stem-loop structure, which are frequently found in the viral RNA region encoding amino acids around the cleavage site of low-pathogenic H5 and H7 viruses isolated from waterfowl reservoirs, are important for nucleotide insertions into this RNA region. A reporter assay to detect nontemplated nucleotide insertions and deep-sequencing analysis of viral RNAs revealed that an increased number of adenine residues and enlarged stem-loop structure in the RNA region accelerated the multiple adenine and/or guanine insertions required to create codons for basic amino acids. Interestingly, nucleotide insertions associated with the HA cleavage site motif were not observed principally in the viral RNA of other subtypes tested (H1, H2, H3, and H4). Our findings suggest that the RNA editing-like activity is the key mechanism for nucleotide insertions, providing a clue as to why the acquisition of the polybasic HA cleavage site is restricted to the particular HA subtypes.</jats:p>

            Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on the antigenicity of the viral surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase. Of the 16 HA subtypes (H1 to -16) maintained in waterfowl reservoirs of influenza A viruses, H5 and H7 viruses often become highly pathogenic through the acquisition of multiple basic amino acid residues at the HA cleavage site. Although this mechanism has been known since the 1980s, the genetic basis for nucleotide insertions has remained unclear. This study shows the potential role of the viral RNA secondary structure for nucleotide insertions and demonstrates a key mechanism explaining why the acquisition of the polybasic HA cleavage site is restricted to particular HA subtypes in nature. Our findings will contribute to better understanding of the ecology of influenza A viruses and will also be useful for the development of genetically modified vaccines against H5 and H7 influenza A viruses with increased stability.

Throughout this period there was a progressive expansion of NDV to new areas, with an increase in the episodes of mortality, although it is not clear whether they were the result of the spread of the virus, or of the improvement of the surveillance. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that two distinct sublineages of NDV, 4a and 4b, were circulating in Catalonia. Both sublineages seem to be endemic in the wild bird population, affecting mainly Eurasian-collared doves, with a clear pattern in relation to its spatial distribution (coincident with the distribution of this species), and its temporal distribution (with the majority of cases between September and February). So far, endemicity in wild birds has not resulted in ND outbreaks in poultry. However, there are still many uncertainties about, for example, whether NDV may expand to new areas of Catalonia (with higher poultry density), or about the threat that the apparently more novel sublineage 4a may represent. Hence, efforts should be made so that measures to prevent infection of poultry farms (particularly in high-risk areas and periods) are encouraged, and surveillance is maintained."

The VP7 (G) and VP4 (P) genes of 32 Canadian RVA strains, circulating between 2009 and 2015 were sequenced, identifying the G3P[13], G5P[7], G9P[7], G9[13], and G9[19] genotype combinations. The Canadian RVA strains were compared to the RVA strains present in the swine ProSystems RCE rotavirus vaccine. The comparison revealed multiple amino acid differences in the G and P antigenic epitopes, regardless of the G and P genotypes but specifically in the Canadian G3, P[13] and P[19] genotypes.

Given the crucial dependency of viruses to reproduce in an intracellular environment, viruses that engage in excessive killing (lysis) can drive their cellular hosts to extinction and will not survive. The lytic mode of virus propagation must, therefore, be tempered and balanced by nonâlytic modes of virus latency and symbiosis. Here, we review recent bioinformatics and metagenomic studies to argue that viral endogenization and domestication may be more frequent mechanisms of virus persistence than lysis. We use a triangle diagram to explain the three major virus persistence strategies that explain the global scope of virusâcell interactions including lysis, latency and virusâcell symbiosis. This paradigm can help identify novel directions in virology research where scientists could artificially gain control over switching lytic and beneficial viral lifestyles.

CAV genome of 1,766 bp nucleotide region containing the complete coding region of VP2 and VP3 proteins, and partial coding region of VP1 protein were sequenced. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the Indian CAV isolates were aligned and compared with CAV isolates of European, Asian, American and Australian origin. Phylogenetic analysis of the Indian CAV isolates were also carried out based on the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences. The results indicated that Indian isolates were genetically evolved from different parts of the world. Indian isolate, CAV-A was found closely related to European Cux-1 strain, CAV-B and -P were closely related to Bangladesh BD-3 strain and CAV-E was closely related to Australian 704 strain. The pathogenicity of the four CAV isolates was studied in day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) chicks. Day-old SPF chicks (n=50) were divided into five groups comprised of 10 chicks in each group. Group 1 was kept as control and groups 2-5 were infected with each CAV isolate separately. The chicks were infected at a dose rate of 1 ml cell culture fluid (10(4.5)TCID(50)/0.1 ml) per bird intramuscularly. The clinical signs, mortality and packed cell volume (PCV) and body weight gain were recorded on 5, 10 and 15 days post-infection. At 15th day, all the birds were sacrificed and various organs, viz., thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver and bursa were examined for gross and microscopic changes. The pathogenicity study indicated that all the CAVs except CAV-B were able to produce clinical disease and immunosuppression in young chicks whereas the isolate CAV-B produced no clinical disease but only induced immunosuppression, which was revealed by microscopic examination of the lymphoid organs. The study showed valuable information on molecular epidemiological status of CAV isolates prevalent in India for the first time."

Serum exosomes can serve as invaluable biomarkers, containing m/miRNAs, lipids, and proteins, indicative of various conditions. There are currently limited studies on the characterization and mutual consensus of biomarker profiles of serum exosomes purified by different methods. Here we compared the advantages and disadvantages of two commonly used serum exosome purification procedures including ultracentrifugation (UC) and Total Exosome Isolation (TEI) reagent, by analyzing exosome size distribution, concentration, morphology and miRNA expression profiles. Serum was obtained from Marek's disease virus (MDV)-infected chickens that were either vaccinated against Marek's disease (MD), and thus protected, or unvaccinated and bearing MDV-induced tumors. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were performed to evaluate particle size, concentration, and morphological integrity, respectively. Our results indicate that the size distribution of particles purified by either procedure is consistent with that of exosomes (30-150ânm). TEI reagent generated higher yields and co-isolated additional EV populations that are slightly larger (â¼180ânm). Based on the miRNA expression profiles from a previous high throughput sequencing experiment of exosome small RNAs, we selected six cellular and four MDV1 miRNAs, to validate their expression in UC- and TEI-purified exosomes. miRNA expression profiles displayed relative correlation between the two procedures, but distinctive differences were observed in abundance with TEI-purified exosomes showing higher miRNA expression consistent with higher yield than those purified by UC. TEI-purified exosomes from vaccinated chickens exhibited greater expression of tumor suppressor miRNA, gga-mir-146b and least expression of oncomiR, gga-mir-21 compared to those obtained from tumor-bearing chickens. We propose that gga-mir-146 and -21 can serve as serum exosome biomarkers for vaccine-induced protection and MD tumors respectively."

Fecal specimens were collected during spring of 2011. No adenoviruses, circoviruses and anelloviruses were detected, however, high prevalence and remarkable genetic diversity within the identified parvoviruses and, particularly, within bocaviruses was observed.

The frequency of mixed infections with various combinations of these virus species reached 20%. Genetic analysis of the identified viruses showed that the capsid gene of PBoV1 and PBoV2 strains shared up to 91% and 94%nt sequence similarities to reference PBoV1 and PBoV2 strains, respectively. The identified PBoV3 and PBoV4 strains shared â¤ 95% and â¤ 98%nt identities with reference PBoV3 and PBoV4 strains, respectively, along the NS gene, whereas the PBoV5 strains shared 86%nt identities with Hungarian and 87%nt identities with Chinese PBoV5 strains along the capsid gene.

            Avian leukosis virus (ALV) induces tumors by integrating its proviral DNA into the chicken genome and altering the expression of nearby genes via strong promoter and enhancer elements. Viral integration sites that contribute to oncogenesis are selected in tumor cells. Deep-sequencing analysis of B-cell lymphoma DNA confirmed that the telomerase reverse transcriptase (
            <jats:italic>TERT</jats:italic>

Clinical symptoms of the disease caused by BVDV range from subclinical to severe acute hemorrhagic syndrome, with the severity of disease being strain dependent. These viruses are classified as members of the Pestivirus genus of the Flaviviridae. BVDV are considered primarily a pathogen of cattle but can infect most ruminant species. The virus particle consists of a lipid bilayer membrane surrounding the encapsidated genomic RNA. Inserted in the outer membrane are two virus-encoded glycoproteins that contain the major antigenic determinants of the virus as well as receptor binding and cell fusion functions. A third glycoprotein is weakly associated with the virion, but also possesses unique features that play important roles in suppression of innate immunity. The viral proteins are encoded in a single, large open reading frame. The viral proteins are proteolytically cleaved from the polyprotein by different proteases. The structural proteins are processed by cellular signal peptidases while the processing of the nonstructural proteins is by the viral serine protease. The virus is assembled and matures in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi bodies of the cell. The virus is released via exocytosis, where viral proteins are not exposed on the surface of the cell."

The 2C RNA helicase primers directed the amplification of this region from eight SMSV serotypes, five VESV serotypes, and four related viruses. The RNA polymerase primer sets amplified products from all these viruses except one. Phylogenetic comparison of the caliciviruses demonstrated that SMSV, VESV, and four related viruses are closely related while being distinct from feline calicivirus, the human caliciviruses (small, round-structured viruses), and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus and that they should be classified as a single genotype within the Caliciviridae.</jats:p>"

Based on the need for immunosuppression in xenotransplantation, procedures developed to enhance safety in allotransplantation can be applied in future xenotransplantation clinical trials. Standardized approaches can be developed to guide the evaluation of common infectious syndromes in xenograft recipients. The opportunity created by screening of swine intended as xenograft donors has equal applicability to allotransplantation-notably broader screening strategies for allograft donors such as use of advanced sequencing modalities including broad-range molecular probes, microarrays, and high-throughput pyrosequencing. Considerations in management of allotransplant- and xenotransplant-associated infections are largely the same. Experience in xenotransplantation will continue to inform thinking regarding donor-derived infections in allotransplantation. We expect that experience in managing complex allotransplant recipients will similarly inform clinical trials in xenotransplantation."

Control of pestiviral diseases is especially difficult due to the constant viremia and viral shedding of persistently infected (PI) animals, which must be identified and eliminated to prevent disease transmission. Existing vaccines are limited by the delay between vaccination and the onset of protection, the difficulty of differentiating serologically between vaccinated and naturally infected animals and the need for broad vaccine cross-protection against diverse virus strains. Antiviral therapy could potentially supplement vaccination by providing immediate protection in the case of an outbreak. Numerous compounds with in vitro antiviral activity against BVDV have been identified through its role as a surrogate for hepatitis C virus. Fewer drugs active against CSFV have been identified, but many compounds that are effective against BVDV will likely inhibit CSFV, given their similar genomic sequences. While in vitro research has been promising, the paucity of efficacy studies in animals has hindered the commercial development of effective antiviral drugs against the pestiviruses. In this article, we summarize the clinical syndromes and routes of transmission of BVD, CSF and border disease, discuss currently approved vaccines, review efforts to develop antiviral therapies for use in outbreak control and suggest promising directions for future research."

In order to identify viruses associated with BRD, we used a metagenomics approach to enrich and sequence viral nucleic acids in the nasal swabs of 50 young dairy cattle with symptoms of BRD. Following deep sequencing, de novo assembly, and translated protein sequence similarity searches, numerous known and previously uncharacterized viruses were identified. Bovine adenovirus 3, bovine adeno-associated virus, bovine influenza D virus, bovine parvovirus 2, bovine herpesvirus 6, bovine rhinitis A virus, and multiple genotypes of bovine rhinitis B virus were identified. The genomes of a previously uncharacterized astrovirus and picobirnaviruses were also partially or fully sequenced. Using real-time PCR, the rates of detection of the eight viruses that generated the most reads were compared for the nasal secretions of 50 animals with BRD versus 50 location-matched healthy control animals. Viruses were detected in 68% of BRD-affected animals versus 16% of healthy control animals. Thirty-eight percent of sick animals versus 8% of controls were infected with multiple respiratory viruses. Significantly associated with BRD were bovine adenovirus 3 (P < 0.0001), bovine rhinitis A virus (P = 0.005), and the recently described bovine influenza D virus (P = 0.006), which were detected either alone or in combination in 62% of animals with BRD. A metagenomics and real-time PCR detection approach in carefully matched cases and controls can provide a rapid means to identify viruses associated with a complex disease, paving the way for further confirmatory tests and ultimately to effective intervention strategies. Bovine respiratory disease is the most economically important disease affecting the cattle industry, whose complex root causes include environmental, genetics, and infectious factors. Using an unbiased metagenomics approach, we characterized the viruses in respiratory secretions from BRD cases and identified known and previously uncharacterized viruses belonging to seven viral families. Using a case-control format with location-matched animals, we compared the rates of viral detection and identified 3 viruses associated with severe BRD signs. Combining a metagenomics and case-control format can provide candidate pathogens associated with complex infectious diseases and inform further studies aimed at reducing their impact."

Here we used viral metagenomics to examine viruses associated with sea turtle fibropapillomatosis (FP), a debilitating neoplastic disease affecting sea turtles worldwide. By means of purifying and shotgun sequencing the viral community directly from the fibropapilloma of a Florida green sea turtle, a novel single-stranded DNA virus, sea turtle tornovirus 1 (STTV1), was discovered. The single-stranded, circular genome of STTV1 was approximately 1,800 nucleotides in length. STTV1 has only weak amino acid level identities (25%) to chicken anemia virus in short regions of its genome; hence, STTV1 may represent the first member of a novel virus family. A total of 35 healthy turtles and 27 turtles with FP were tested for STTV1 using PCR, and only 2 turtles severely afflicted with FP were positive. The affected turtles were systemically infected with STTV1, since STTV1 was found in blood and all major organs. STTV1 exists as a quasispecies, with several genome variants identified in the fibropapilloma of each positive turtle, suggesting rapid evolution of this virus. The STTV1 variants were identical over the majority of their genomes but contained a hypervariable region with extensive divergence. This study demonstrates the potential of viral metagenomics for discovering novel viruses directly from animal tissue, which can enhance our understanding of viral evolution and diversity."

Retrospective studies revealed the prevalence of PPV6 in aborted pig fetuses and piglets(50% and 75%, respectively) was apparently higher than that in finishing pigs and sows (15.6% and 3.8% respectively).

This finding indicates that animal age, perhaps due to increased innate immune resistance, strongly influences the level of PPV6 viremia. Complete genome sequencing and multiple alignments have shown that the nearly full-length genome sequences were approximately 6,100 nucleotides in length and shared 20.5%-42.6% DNA sequence identity with other members of the Parvovirinae subfamily. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PPV6 was significantly distinct from other known parvoviruses and was most closely related to PPV4. Our findings and review of published parvovirus sequences suggested that a novel porcine parvovirus is currently circulating in China and might be classified into the novel genus Copiparvovirus within the subfamily Parvovirinae. However, the clinical manifestations of PPV6 are still unknown in that the prevalence of PPV6 was similar between healthy pigs and sick pigs in a retrospective epidemiological study. The identification of PPV6 within the subfamily Parvovirinae provides further insight into the viral and genetic diversity of parvoviruses."

The virus is currently unclassified: the organisation of the genome resembles that of the <jats:italic>Caliciviridae</jats:italic> but sequence analyses suggest it is more closely related to the <jats:italic>Togaviridae</jats:italic>. Hepatitis E virus is an enterically transmitted virus that causes both epidemics and sporadic cases of acute hepatitis in many countries of Asia and Africa but only rarely causes disease in more industrialised countries. Initially the virus was believed to have a limited geographical distribution. However, serological studies suggest that HEV may be endemic also in the United States and Europe even though it infrequently causes overt disease in these countries. Many different animal species worldwide recently have been shown to have antibodies to HEV suggesting that hepatitis E may be zoonotic. Although two related strains have been experimentally transmitted between species, direct transmission from an animal to a human has not been documented. There are four currently recognised genotypes and two of the four contain viruses isolated from swine as well as from humans. Regardless of country of origin or genotype of the virus, most, if not all, strains belong to a single serotype. A promising recombinant vaccine candidate comprised of a truncated capsid protein is currently under evaluation in Nepal. Published in 2003 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>"

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 6 HEV RNAs belonged to genotype 3 and were classified into groups A and B. In group B, mongoose-derived HEV sequences were very similar to mongoose HEV previously detected on Okinawa Island, as well as to those of a pig.

However, little is known about the H5N1 influenza viruses that have been circulating there in recent years. We therefore conducted surveillance studies and isolated eight H5N1 viruses from chickens. Phylogenic analysis of their hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes revealed that all eight viruses belonged to clade 2.1.3. However, on the basis of nucleotide differences, these viruses could be divided into two groups. Other viruses genetically closely related to these two groups of viruses were all Indonesian isolates, suggesting that these new isolates have been evolving within Indonesia. Among these viruses, two distinct viruses circulated in the Kalimantan islands during the same season in 2010. Our data reveal the continued evolution of H5N1 viruses in Indonesia."

SVDV is the causative agent of a highly contagious (though rarely fatal) vesicular disease in pigs. We report a rapid method that is suitable for sequencing the complete protein-encoding sequences of SVDV isolates in which the RNA is relatively intact. The approach couples a single PCR amplification reaction, using only a single PCR primer set to amplify the near-complete SVDV genome, with deep-sequencing using a small fraction of the capacity of a Roche GS FLX sequencing platform. Sequences were initially verified through one of two criteria; either a match between a de novo assembly and a reference mapping, or a match between all of five different reference mappings performed against a fixed set of starting reference genomes with significant genetic distances within the same species of viruses. All reference mappings used an iterative method to avoid bias. Further verification was achieved through phylogenetic analysis against published SVDV genomes and additional Enterovirus B sequences. This approach allows high confidence in the obtained consensus sequences, as well as provides sufficiently high and evenly dispersed sequence coverage to allow future studies of intra-host variation."

Classical swine fever (CSF), one of the most economically important and highly contagious swine diseases worldwide, is caused by classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to obtain the digital gene expression (DGE) profile in swine umbilical vein endothelial cells (SUVEC) to identify different response genes for CSFV by using both Shimen and C strains. The numbers of clean tags obtained from the libraries of the control and both CSFV-infected libraries were 3,473,370, 3,498,355, and 3,327,493 respectively. In the comparison among the control, CSFV-C, and CSFV-Shimen groups, 644, 158, and 677 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were confirmed in the three groups. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that many of these DEGs were enriched in spliceosome, ribosome, proteasome, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, cell cycle, focal adhesion, Wnt signalling pathway, etc., where the processes differ between CSFV strains of differing virulence. To further elucidate important mechanisms related to the differential infection by the CSFV Shimen and C strains, we identified four possible profiles to assess the significantly expressed genes only by CSFV Shimen or CSFV C strain. GO analysis showed that infection with CSFV Shimen and C strains disturbed 'RNA splicing' of SUVEC, resulting in differential 'gene expression' in SUVEC. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was identified as a significant response regulator contributed to impact on SUVEC function for CSFV Shimen. This computational study suggests that CSFV of differing virulence could induce alterations in RNA splicing regulation in the host cell to change cell metabolism, resulting in acute haemorrhage and pathological damage or infectious tolerance."

This genus also includes the HoBi-like virus, tentatively classified as BVDV type 3. BVDV-1 is widely distributed in Italy despite the extensive use of BVDV-1-based vaccines, while BVDV-2 and HoBi-like Pestivirus have been detected occasionally. Monitoring the occurrence of sporadic or atypical pestiviruses is a useful approach to evaluate the need for additional vaccine strains that can be used in BVDV control programs. In this study we developed a multiwell antibody ELISA based on the recombinant E2 protein of the three bovine pestiviruses. We evaluated the assay's applicability for surveillance purposes using pooled milk samples, each prepared from a maximum of 35 lactating cows and collected from 176 dairy herds. As expected, the majority of the pooled samples reacted to a greater extent against the BVDV-1 E2 antigen. All three milk pools from a single farm reacted to the BVDV-2 antigen, however. Further analysis using spot tests, antigen detection, and sequence analysis of the 5'-UTR region confirmed the presence of five persistently infected calves carrying a BVDV-2a strain. This study highlights for the first time that sporadic circulation of BVDV-2 can be predicted by immunoenzymatic methods in the absence of specific vaccination."

MicroRNAs are a class of 17-25 nucleotide non- coding RNAs that have been shown to have critical functions in a wide variety of biological processes, such as cell differentiation, cell cycle regulation, carcinogenesis, apoptosis, regulation of immunity as well as in viral infections by cleavage or translational repression of mRNAs. Nevertheless, there is no information about miRNA expression in an ASFV infection. In this proof-of-concept study, we have analyzed miRNAs expressed in spleen and submandibular lymph node of experimentally infected pigs with a virulent (E75) or its derived attenuated (E75CV1) ASFV strain, as well as, at different times post-infection with the virulent strain, by high throughput sequencing of small RNA libraries. Spleen presented a more differential expression pattern than lymph nodes in an ASFV infection. Of the most abundant miRNAs, 12 were differentially expressed in both tissues at two different times in infected animals with the virulent strain. Of these, miR-451, miR-145-5p, miR-181a and miR-122 presented up-regulation at late times post-infection while miR-92a, miR-23a, miR-92b-3p, miR-126-5p, miR-126-3p, miR-30d, miR-23b and miR-92c showed down-regulation. Of the 8 differentially expressed miRNAs identified at the same time post-infection in infected animals with the virulent strain compared with animals infected with its attenuated strain, miR-126-5p, miR-92c, miR-92a, miR-30e-5p and miR-500a-5p presented up-regulation whereas miR-125b, miR-451 and miR-125a were down-regulated. All these miRNAs have been shown to be associated with cellular genes involved in pathways related to the immune response, virus-host interactions as well as with several viral genes. The study of miRNA expression will contribute to a better understanding of African swine fever virus pathogenesis, essential in the development of any disease control strategy."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a new class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. miRNAs play an increasing role in many biological processes. The study of miRNA-mediated host-pathogen interactions has emerged in the last decade due to the important role that miRNAs play in antiviral defense. The objective of this study was to identify the miRNA expression pattern in PCV2 subclinically infected and non-infected pigs. For this purpose an experimental PCV2 infection was carried out and small-RNA libraries were constructed from tonsil and mediastinal lymph node (MLN) of infected and non-infected pigs. High throughput sequencing determined differences in miRNA expression in MLN between infected and non-infected while, in tonsil, a very conserved pattern was observed. In MLN, miRNA 126-3p, miRNA 126-5p, let-7d-3p, mir-129a and mir-let-7b-3p were up-regulated whereas mir-193a-5p, mir-574-5p and mir-34a down-regulated. Prediction of functional analysis showed that these miRNAs can be involved in pathways related to immune system and in processes related to the pathogenesis of PCV2, although functional assays are needed to support these predictions. This is the first study on miRNA gene expression in pigs infected with PCV2 using a high throughput sequencing approach in which several host miRNAs were differentially expressed in response to PCV2 infection."

The discovery of virus specific miRNAs has increased both in number and importance in the past few years. We have recently described the differential expression of several porcine miRNAs during in vivo infection with attenuated and virulent ASFV strains. Here, we have extended these studies trying to identify the presence of viral miRNAs encoded by ASFV in an in vivo infection in pigs. Sixteen small RNA libraries were analyzed from spleen and submandibular lymph nodes obtained from eight pigs, seven infected with either the virulent E75 ASFV strain or its attenuated counterpart E75CV1, or from pigs surviving E75CV1-infection and challenged with BA71 (heterologous challenge) and one non infected as negative control. Samples were recovered at different times post-infection. Libraries were analyzed by next-generation sequencing. Some viral miRNA candidates were initially identified, which did not correspond to porcine miRNAs. Further structural analyses were carried out in order to confirm if they met the conformational requirements to be considered a viral miRNA. The analysis of sixteen small RNA libraries prepared from two different tissues obtained from pigs experimentally infected with E75, E75CV1 or with E75CV1 plus BA71, revealed the presence of six potential miRNA sequences but none of them met the requirements to be considered as viral miRNAs. Thus, we can conclude that ASFV does not express miRNAs in vivo, at least under the experimental conditions described here."

In the present study, we identified novel PTVs that are distantly related to Teschovirus A and were found in fecal samples of pigs with or without diarrhea in Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid (aa) sequences of the complete coding region revealed that these newly identified viruses did not cluster with any strains of PTVs or other strains within the picornavirus supergroup 1, suggesting that the viruses may not belong to Teschovirus A or any genus of the family Picornaviridae.

Since the picornavirus VP1 protein contains a number of neutralization domains, we hypothesized that the VP1 sequence should correspond with neutralization (serotype) and, hence, with phylogenetic lineage. To test this hypothesis and to analyze the phylogenetic relationships among the human enteroviruses, we determined the complete VP1 sequences of the prototype strains of 47 human enterovirus serotypes and 10 antigenic variants. Our sequences, together with those available from GenBank, comprise a database of complete VP1 sequences for all 66 human enterovirus serotypes plus additional strains of seven serotypes. Phylogenetic trees constructed from complete VP1 sequences produced the same four major clusters as published trees based on partial VP2 sequences; in contrast to the VP2 trees, however, in the VP1 trees strains of the same serotype were always monophyletic. In pairwise comparisons of complete VP1 sequences, enteroviruses of the same serotype were clearly distinguished from those of heterologous serotypes, and the limits of intraserotypic divergence appeared to be about 25% nucleotide sequence difference or 12% amino acid sequence difference. Pairwise comparisons suggested that coxsackie A11 and A15 viruses should be classified as strains of the same serotype, as should coxsackie A13 and A18 viruses. Pairwise identity scores also distinguished between enteroviruses of different clusters and enteroviruses from picornaviruses of different genera.

To further characterize this group of viruses and to clarify their classification within the Picornaviridae, we have determined the complete genomic sequence of SV2 (8126 nucleotides). The genome was typical of members of Picornaviridae, encoding a single open reading frame. The putative polyprotein contained typical picornavirus protease cleavage sites, yielding mature proteins homologous to each of the known picornavirus proteins. SV2 contained an amino-terminal extension of the reading frame, which was analogous to the leader protein of members of the Aphthovirus, Cardiovirus, Erbovirus, Kobuvirus, and Teschovirus genera, but there was no significant amino acid homology with any of these known leader proteins. The 2A protein also aligned poorly with the 2A proteins of other picornaviruses. The deduced amino acid sequences of the SV2 structural and nonstructural proteins were related to but phylogenetically distinct from those of enteroviruses and human rhinoviruses. The major distinguishing features of SV2 were the presence of a type 2 internal ribosome entry site in the 5'-NTR, a putative leader protein encoded upstream of the structural proteins, and an unusually large 2A protein. On the basis of the molecular analysis, we propose that SV2, SV16, SV18, SV42, SV44, SV45, SV49, and porcine enterovirus 8 be classified as members of a new genus in Picornaviridae and that SV2 (strain 2383) be designated as the type strain."

The prevalence of BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 infections and its genotypes in Mongolian animals has not been studied. In this study, we surveyed BVDV infection in dairy cattle and yaks from Bornuur and Bulgan counties by RT-PCR, and the average infection rate in the sampling sites was 15.8Â % and 20.0Â %, respectively. In addition, molecular features of the 5'-UTR region of the BVDV genome in Mongolian cattle and yaks were identified as belonging to the subtypes BVDV-1a and BVDV-2a, respectively. Determining the prevalence, geographical distribution, and molecular diversity of BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 in various host species in Mongolia is important for further studies and process control programs."

Genetic affiliation and their association with the clinical manifestation were carried out with five BVDV isolates from an outbreak of mucosal disease (MD) (Outbreak #1), acute enteritis (Outbreaks #2 and #3) and generalized dermatitis (Outbreaks #4 and #5). Upon genetic analysis CP BVDV isolate of Outbreak #1 clustered to closely to BVDV Oregon (Genotype 1). BVDV isolates from the outbreaks of generalized dermatitis (Outbreaks #4 and #5) were located close to BVDV Osloss within Genotype 1. The identification by immunohistochemistry of BVDV in exudative dermatitis indicates the epithelial cell tropism of the virus. Phylogenic characterization of BVDV from Outbreaks #2 and #3 locate them as BVDV-2. 5'UTR sequence of these viruses revealed a homology of 88 and 90% to BVDV-890 (Genotype 2) and a 77 and 75% to BVDV-SD1 (Genotype 1), respectively. The association of BVDV-2 with severe disease indicates the presence of highly virulent strains. Data from natural outbreaks where BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 were isolated revealed that pathology overlaps and not clearly allows the differentiation between genotypes based on gross or microscopic lesions. Thus, for a definitive diagnosis, further virology and molecular studies are necessary. Additionally, the results of this work focused on the origin and consequences of genetic variations of BVDV with regard to pathogenesis and suggest the association between genotype and a defined clinical syndrome."

Thirteen Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) and 1 Malayan sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) were apparently affected. In August 2011, an adult bear became lethargic, and developed footpad vesicles. Over 15 days, 14 out of 17 bears developed similar signs; the remaining 3 co-housed bears and another 57 resident bears did not. All affected bears developed vesicles on all footpads, and most were lethargic for 24-48 hr. Nasal and oral lesions were noted in 6 and 3 cases, respectively. Within 1 month, all looked normal. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, classified as serotype O, and isolated by virus isolation techniques. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated clustering of 3 bear isolates, in a branch distinct from other FMDV type O isolates. The outbreak likely occurred due to indirect contact with livestock, and was facilitated by the high density of captive bears.

               <jats:p>MutS proteins are ubiquitous in cellular organisms and have important roles in DNA mismatch repair or recombination. In the virus world, the amoeba-infecting Mimivirus, as well as the recently sequenced Cafeteria roenbergensis virus are known to encode a MutS related to the homologs found in octocorals and É-proteobacteria. To explore the presence of MutS proteins in other viral genomes, we performed a genomic survey of four giant viruses (âgirusesâ) (Pyramimonas orientalis virus (PoV), Phaeocystis pouchetii virus (PpV), Chrysochromulina ericina virus (CeV) and Heterocapsa circularisquama DNA virus (HcDNAV)) that infect unicellular marine algae. Our analysis revealed the presence of a close homolog of Mimivirus MutS in all the analyzed giruses. These viral homologs possess a specific domain structure, including a C-terminal HNH-endonuclease domain, defining the new MutS7 subfamily. We confirmed the presence of conserved mismatch recognition residues in all members of the MutS7 subfamily, suggesting their role in DNA mismatch repair rather than DNA recombination. PoV and PpV were found to contain an additional type of MutS, which we propose to call MutS8. The MutS8 proteins in PoV and PpV were found to be closely related to homologs from âCandidatus Amoebophilus asiaticusâ, an obligate intracellular amoeba-symbiont belonging to the Bacteroidetes. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that MutS7 and MutS8 are abundant in marine microbial metagenomes and that a vast majority of these environmental sequences are likely of girus origin. Giruses thus seem to represent a major source of the underexplored diversity of the MutS family in the microbial world.</jats:p>"

HcDNAV lytically infects the bivalve-killing marine dinoflagellate H. circularisquama, and currently represents the sole DNA virus isolated from dinoflagellates, one of the most abundant protists in marine ecosystems. Its morphological features, genome type, and host range previously suggested that HcDNAV might be a member of the family Phycodnaviridae of Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDVs), though no supporting sequence data was available. NCLDVs currently include two families found in aquatic environments (Phycodnaviridae, Mimiviridae), one mostly infecting terrestrial animals (Poxviridae), another isolated from fish, amphibians and insects (Iridoviridae), and the last one (Asfarviridae) exclusively represented by the animal pathogen African swine fever virus (ASFV), the agent of a fatal hemorrhagic disease in domestic swine. In this study, we determined the complete sequence of the type B DNA polymerase (PolB) gene of HcDNAV. The viral PolB was transcribed at least from 6 h post inoculation (hpi), suggesting its crucial function for viral replication. Most unexpectedly, the HcDNAV PolB sequence was found to be closely related to the PolB sequence of ASFV. In addition, the amino acid sequence of HcDNAV PolB showed a rare amino acid substitution within a motif containing highly conserved motif: YSDTDS was found in HcDNAV PolB instead of YGDTDS in most dsDNA viruses. Together with the previous observation of ASFV-like sequences in the Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling metagenomic datasets, our results further reinforce the ideas that the terrestrial ASFV has its evolutionary origin in marine environments."

In the present study, we isolated MVV from one sheep to confirm MVV infection and conducted genomic classification of the virus. The co-culture of leukocytes from a seropositive sheep with fetal goat lung cells resulted in the formation of syncytial cells and the amplification of a long terminal repeat sequence of MVV by polymerase chain reaction. The isolate was confirmed as being MVV, rather than the caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus based on phylogenetic analysis of the gag gene sequence. Although the sheep was asymptomatic, nonpurulent meningitis and demyelination were found in the spinal cord. These were considered to be early lesions associated with pathogenic MVV infection. Therefore, the present study demonstrated that MVV is distributed in Japan."

          <jats:p>The Japanese isolates of Palyam serogroup viruses isolated from 1985 to 2001 were investigated for the genome sequence of segments 2 and 7 and were phylogenetically analyzed in comparison with Australian and African isolates of the same serogroup. The nucleotide sequences of segment 7 were highly conserved within Japanese isolates (95.1 to 100%) and between Japanese and Taiwanese isolates (96.0 to 100%), whereas the identities between Japanese and Taiwanese isolates and Australian and African isolates were fairly conserved (84.2 to 92.0%). Phylogenetic analysis based on segment 7 revealed three clusters according to geographical origin. As a result of the nucleotide sequence analysis of segment 2, which encodes a serotype-specific antigen, Japanese isolates were classified into two groups by genome length and nucleotide identities. Four of the nine Japanese isolates were categorized into the same group as prototype strain K-47 of the Chuzan virus, and the remaining isolates were categorized into the same group as the D'Aguilar virus and Nyabira virus. Phylogenetic analysis based on segment 2 revealed two clusters, the cluster containing Chuzan virus and the cluster containing the D'Aguilar and Nyabira viruses. To examine the antigenic relationship among viruses categorized in different clusters, we conducted a cross-neutralization test. KSB-29/E/01, isolated in 2001 in Japan, was neutralized by antiserum not only to strain B8112 of D'Aguilar virus but also to Chuzan virus. These results indicated that genetically and antigenically unique characteristics of KSB-29/E/01 were attributed to genetic reassortment of segment 2 between Chuzan virus and D'Aguilar virus.</jats:p>"

However, much of MVC is still obscure since only a limited number of MVC isolates have been available for the study. MVC infections of Japanese and Korean dogs were epidemiologically studied in the previous study, and several MVC isolates could be cultivated in vitro. In the present study an almost full-length nucleotide sequence of a Korean MVC strain HM-6 genome was obtained and comparatively analyzed with those of the American MVC strain GA3 characterized recently. Genome structure of the HM-6 strain was similar to the GA3 strain showing 96.4% identity at the nucleotide sequence. Each of the deduced amino acid sequences of NS1, NP-1, and VP1/2 showed homology of 96.5%, 92.5%, and 97.5% between the HM-6 and GA3 strains. When compared with other parvovirus species, the HM-6 strain was most closely related to bovine parvovirus (BPV) as described for the GA3 strain.

Although the complete genomic sequences of GIX-GXII, and GXV SaVs are unavailable, common features of SaV genomes include: 1) ""GTG"" at the 5'-end of the genome, and a short (9~14 nt) 5'-untranslated region; and 2) the first five amino acids (M [A/V] S [K/R] P) of the putative NS1 and the five amino acids (FEMEG) surrounding the putative cleavage site between NS7 and VP1 were conserved among the chimpanzee, two of five genogroups of pig (GV and GVIII), sea lion, canine, and human SaVs. In contrast, these two amino acid motifs were clearly different in three genogroups of porcine (GIII, GVI and GVII), and bat SaVs.

To genetically characterize SIVs circulating in Japanese pig populations, we isolated 24 SIVs of three subtypes (17 H1N1, four H1N2 and three H3N2 strains) from 14 pig farms in Japan from 2013 to 2016. Genetic analyses revealed that the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the 17 H1N1 and the HA gene of one H1N2, A/swine/Aichi/02/2016 (H1N2), SIVs belonged to the A(H1N1)pdm09 lineage. More importantly, all of the remaining six gene segments (i.e., PB1, PB1, PA, NP, M and NS) of the 24 SIVs, regardless of the HA and NA subtype, were also classified as belonging to the A(H1N1)pdm09 lineage. These results indicate that gene segments of A(H1N1)pdm09 lineage are widely distributed in SIVs circulating in Japanese pig populations In addition, the NA gene of A/swine/Aichi/02/2016 (H1N2) shared less than 88.5% nucleotide identity with that of the closest relative A/swine/Miyagi/5/2003 (H1N2), which was isolated in Japan in 2003. These results indicate the sustained circulation of classical H1N2-derived SIVs with remarkable diversity in the NA genes in Japanese pig populations. These findings highlight the necessity of both intensive biosecurity systems and active SIV surveillance in pig populations worldwide for both animal and public health."

Economic losses attributable to ILT affect many poultry-producing areas throughout the United States (US) and the world. Despite efforts to control the disease by vaccination, prolonged epidemics of ILT remain a threat to the poultry industry. Earlier epidemiological and molecular evidence indicated that outbreaks in the US are caused by vaccine-related strains. In this study, polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of four genome regions was utilized to characterize 25 isolates from commercial poultry and backyard flocks from the US. Combinations of PCR-RFLP patterns classified the ILT virus isolates into nine groups. Backyard flock isolates were categorized in three separate groups. The ILT virus US Department of Agriculture (USDA) reference strain and the tissue culture origin (TCO) vaccine strain were categorized into two separate groups. Twenty-two isolates from commercial poultry were categorized into four groups: one group, of six isolates, showed patterns identical to the chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccines; a second group, of nine isolates, differed in only one pattern from the CEO vaccines; a third group, of two isolates, differed in only one pattern from the TCO vaccine; a fourth group, of five isolates, differed in six and nine patterns from the CEO and TCO vaccines, respectively. Results obtained from this study clearly demonstrated that most of the commercial poultry isolates (17 of 22 isolates) were closely related to the vaccine strains. However, isolates different to the vaccine strains were also identified in commercial poultry."

The present work aimed at extending previous study based on the analysis of a larger number of animals from single-species flocks. Animals were selected for genetic analysis based on serological reactivity towards a range of recombinant antigens derived from Gag and Env viral proteins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of subtypes B2 and A12 in both goats and sheep and subtypes A1 and B1 in goats only. In addition, two novel subtypes, A16 and A17, were found in goats. Co-infections with strains belonging to different subtypes within A and B groups were detected in 1 sheep and 4 goats originating from four flocks. Although the reactivity of serum samples towards the recombinant antigens confirmed immunological relatedness between Gag epitopes of different subtypes and the cross-reactive nature of Gag antibodies, eleven serum samples failed to react with antigens representing all subtypes detected up-to-date in Poland, highlighting the limitations of the serological diagnosis. These data showed the complex nature of SRLV subtypes circulating in sheep and goats in Poland and the need for improving SRLV-related diagnostic capacity."

The sequences of all the epitopes were well conserved in European-type PRRSV and even between European- and American-type PRRSV. Accordingly, sera from pigs infected with American-type PRRSV cross-reacted with the European-type epitopes. Thus, this study showed, for the first time, the presence of highly conserved epitopes in the matrix protein and envelope glycoproteins of PRRSV. ORF5 and 6 epitopes localized to protein parts that are predicted to be hidden in PRRSV virions. In contrast, ORF2 and 3 epitopes localized to putative protein ectodomains. Due to the interesting localization, the sequence surrounding the ORF2 and 3 epitopes was subjected to closer scrutiny. A heptad motif, VSRRIYQ, which is present in a single copy in ORF2 and 3 proteins, was identified; this arrangement is completely conserved in all European-type PRRSV sequences available. The VSRRIYQ repeat motif colocalized closely with one of the ORF2 epitopes and secondary structure modelling showed that this segment of the ORF2 protein could form an amphipathic helix. Intriguingly, a mutation associated with virulence/attenuation of an American vaccine strain of PRRSV also localized to this ORF2 protein segment and affected the hydrophobic face of the predicted amphipathic helix. Further work is needed to determine whether these findings delineate a functional domain in the PRRSV ORF2 protein.</jats:p>"

Despite the overwhelming scale of the epizootic, the CSF virus (CSFV) strain causing the outbreak has remained largely uncharacterized. The Dutch epizootic is epidemiologically linked to a small CSF outbreak in 1997, in Paderborn in Germany. E2 and partial 5' NTR sequencing has shown that the index Paderborn isolate, and several Dutch isolates taken during the 1997-1998 epizootic, are virtually identical, confirming that the Paderborn isolate triggered the Dutch outbreak, and furthermore showing that this single isolate was stable throughout the whole Dutch outbreak (the above reviewed in [C. Terpstra, A. J. de Smit, Veterinary Microbiol. 77 (2000) 3-15]). We determined the nucleotide sequence of the 5' NTR (by 5' RACE) and the complete open reading frame of the Paderborn isolate (GenBank AY072924). Our sequence was identical to previously published partial 5'NTR and E2 sequences for the index Paderborn 1997 and Dutch 1997 (Venhorst) isolates, confirming the identity of the virus we sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete open reading frame showed that Paderborn is genetically very different from common European laboratory reference strains. Neutralization studies showed that Paderborn is also antigenically very different from common laboratory strains such as Alfort 187. Paderborn is the only recent European CSFV field isolate for which a complete sequence is available, and given Paderborns genetic and antigenic uniqueness, the Paderborn sequence may have practical use for diagnostic and vaccine antigen development."

In this study we have performed phylogenetic analyses based on whole capsid gene and complete HEV genomic sequences in order to evaluate the current classification of HEV at genotype and subtype levels. The results of our analyses modify the current taxonomy of genotype 3 and refine the established system for typing of HEV. In addition we suggest a classification for hepeviruses recently isolated from bats, ferrets, rats and wild boar."

Genetic analyses showed that this duck virus has the same human/classical swine/avian reassortant genotype as the H1N2 viruses that have been isolated from pigs and turkeys in the US since 1999. Phylogenetic analyses of each gene segment further confirmed that the Dk/NC virus is closely related to the domestic animal H1N2 isolates. In particular, Dk/NC is most closely related to a swine H1N2 virus also isolated in North Carolina. These two viruses and a phylogenetically-defined subset of additional swine H1N2 viruses share a common mutation in the Sb antigenic site on the hemagglutinin protein. The recovery of Dk/NC from a wild bird raises concerns for further widespread distribution of these H1N2 viruses via waterfowl migration."

The pathogenesis of PPMV-1 infections in poultry is largely obscure. It is known that PPMV-1 requires a series of passages in chickens before it becomes adapted to gallinaceous poultry. Changes in the genome of PPMV-1 were analysed after serial passages in specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens, using high-throughput sequencing. Additionally, histopathological lesions induced by PPMV-1 in experimentally inoculated pigeons, chickens, and turkeys were evaluated. Following six passages of PPMV-1 in chickens, 10 nonsynonymous substitutions were found including one (in the NP protein) which dominated the genetic pool of viral quasispecies. Histopathological changes induced by the post-passage PPMV-1 strain were more prominent than changes wrought by the pre-passaged PPMV-1 strain and the lesions were most intense in pigeons followed by chickens and turkeys. PPMV-1 is highly adapted to pigeons and passaging through chickens results in the acquisition of novel amino acids in the polymerase complex, which may alter the pathogenic potential of the virus."

We estimated the rate of synonymous (silent) substitution for hepatitis B virus to be 4.57 x 10(-5) per site per year. Applying this rate to the phylogenetic tree, we estimated that duck hepatitis B virus diverged from a common ancestor about 30,000 years ago at the earliest, that woodchuck hepatitis virus and ground squirrel hepatitis virus diverged about 10,000 years ago, and that hepatitis B virus diverged within the last 3000 years.

HPAI H5N1 was first reported in Bangladesh in 2007, and since then 546 outbreaks have been reported to the OIE. The disease has apparently become endemic in Bangladesh. Spatio-temporal information on 177 outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 occurring between February 2010 and April 2011 in Bangladesh, and 37 of these outbreaks in which isolated H5N1 viruses were phylogenetically characterized to clade, were analyzed. Three clades were identified, 2.2 (21 cases), 2.3.4 (2 cases) and 2.3.2.1 (14 cases). Clade 2.2 was identified throughout the time period and was widely distributed in a southeast-northwest orientation. Clade 2.3.2.1 appeared later and was generally confined to central Bangladesh in a north-south orientation. Based on a direction test, clade 2.2 viruses spread in a southeast-to-northwest direction, whereas clade 2.3.2.1 spread west-to-east. The magnitude of spread of clade 2.3.2.1 was greater relative to clade 2.2 (angular concentration 0.2765 versus 0.1860). In both cases, the first outbreak(s) were identified as early outliers, but in addition, early outbreaks (one each) of clade 2.2 were also identified in central Bangladesh and in northwest Bangladesh, a considerable distance apart. The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in Bangladesh is characterized by reported long-distance translocation events. This poses a challenge to disease control efforts. Increased enforcement of biosecurity and stronger control of movements between affected farms and susceptible farms, and better surveillance and reporting, is needed. Although the movement of poultry and equipment appears to be a more likely explanation for the patterns identified, the relative contribution of trade and the market chain versus wild birds in spreading the disease needs further investigation."

The infected chickens are characterized by aplastic anaemia and extreme immunosuppression, followed by the increased susceptibility to secondary infectious pathogens and suboptimal immune responses for vaccination. Commercially available CIA vaccines are routinely used in the breeders in Taiwan to protect their progeny with maternal-derived antibodies. However, CIA cases still occur in the field and little is known about the genetic characteristics of Taiwanese chicken anaemia viruses (CAVs). In this study, CAV DNA was detected in 72 of 137 flocks collected during 2010-2015. Among the PCR-positive samples, the coding regions of 51 CAVs were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene revealed that, although most of Taiwanese CAVs belonged to genotypes II and III, some isolates were clustered into a novel genotype (genotype IV). Moreover, a Taiwanese isolate in this novel genotype IV appeared to be derived from a recombination event between genotypes II and III viruses. Five Taiwanese CAV isolates were highly similar to the vaccine strains, 26P4 or Del-Ros. Taken together, these results indicate that the sequences of CAVs in Taiwan are variable, and inter-genotypic recombination had occurred between viruses of different genotypes. Moreover, vaccine-like strains might induce clinical signs of CIA in chickens. Our findings could be useful for understanding the evolution of CAVs and development of a better control strategy for CIA."

The spread of the highly contagious peste des petits ruminants (PPR) disease, which is caused by an RNA virus, PPRV, across Asia and Africa remains a major concern. The present study explored the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of PPRV through the analyses of partial N-gene and F-gene sequences of the virus. All the four previously described PPRV lineages (I-IV) diverged from their common ancestor during the late-19(th) to early-20(th) century. Among the four lineages, PPRV-IV showed pronounced genetic structuring across the region; however, haplotype sharing among the geographic regions, together with the presence of multiple genetic clusters within a country, indicates the possibility of frequent mobility of the diseased individuals across the region. The gradual decline in the effective number of infections suggests a limited genetic variation, which could be attributed to the effective vaccination that has been practiced since 1990s. However, the movement of infected animals across the region likely contributes to the spread of PPRV-IV. No evidence of positive selection was identified from this study."

To gain insights into the dynamics of nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous substitutions (dS) and the ratio between the two (Ï=dN/dS), we analyzed the complete nucleotide coding sequence data of the M segment, which encodes glycoproteins of two negative-sense RNA viruses, Akabane virus (AKV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) that belong to the same serogroup. While AKV is relatively older and has been circulating in ruminant populations since 1970s, SBV was first reported in 2011. The Ï was estimated to be 1.67 and 0.09 for SBV and AKV, respectively, and the estimated mutation rate of SBV is at least 25 times higher than that of AKV. Given the different evolutionary stages of the two viruses, most of the slightly deleterious mutations were likely purged out or kept in low frequency in the AKV genome, whereas positive selection together with the accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations might contribute to such an inflated mutation rate of SBV. The evolutionary distance (d) is nonlinearly and negatively correlated with Ï, but is positively correlated with dN and dS. Collectively, the different patterns in Ï, dN, dS, and d between AKV and SBV identified in this study provide empirical evidence for a time-dependent selection pressure."

Among the 218 animals sampled, 186 were analyzed by ELISA, resulting in 88 (47.3%) reactive samples. In the serum neutralization test (SN), 57/179 (31.8%) samples presented antibodies against the AD virus (SuHV-1).

The amplification of SuHV-1 glycoprotein fragments in the fetuses of seropositive sows indicate that the vertical transmission contribute to maintain SuHV-1 in a free-living feral swine population. The origin of AD in the feral swine populations of the Pantanal is unknown, however, the determination of viral latency, the vertical transmission of the antigen by the amplification of SuHV-1 glycoprotein fragments in the fetuses of seropositive sows and genome typing contribute to the elucidation of the epidemiology of this disease in the wetlands of MS, Brazil."

PRV is a novel reovirus identified by unbiased high throughput DNA sequencing and a bioinformatics program focused on nucleotide frequency as well as sequence alignment and motif analyses. Formal implication of PRV in HSMI will require isolation in cell culture and fulfillment of Koch's postulates, or prevention or modification of disease through use of specific drugs or vaccines. Nonetheless, as our data indicate that a causal relationship is plausible, measures must be taken to control PRV not only because it threatens domestic salmon production but also due to the potential for transmission to wild salmon populations."

Turkey astroviruses were found in 83.67% of the cases and turkey astrovirus 2 (TAst-2) in 26.53%. The investigations directly demonstrated the high prevalence of turkey parvovirus (TuPV) in 23 flocks (46.9%) experiencing signs of ED, making this pathogen the second most identified after astroviruses. Phylogenetic analysis on a 527 base pair-long region from the NS1 gene revealed two main clusters, a chicken parvovirus (ChPV) and a TuPV group, but also the presence of a divergent branch of tentatively named ""TuPV-like ChPV"" strains. The 23 Hungarian TuPV strains were separately positioned in two groups from the American origin sequences in the TuPV cluster. An Avail-based restriction fragment length polymorphism assay has also been developed for the quick differentiation of TuPV, ChPV, and divergent TuPV-like ChPV strains. As most detected enteric viruses have been directly demonstrated in healthy turkey flocks as well, the epidemiology of this disease complex remains unclear, suggesting that a certain combination of pathogens, environmental factors, or both are necessary for the development of clinical signs."

(Walp)) is an annual tropical grain legume. Often referred to as ""poor man's meat"", cowpea is one of the most important subsistence legumes cultivated in West Africa due to the high protein content of its seeds. However, African cowpea production can be seriously constrained by viral diseases that reduce yields. While twelve cowpea-infecting viruses have been reported from Africa, only three of these have so-far been reported from Burkina Faso. Here we use a virion-associated nucleic acids (VANA)-based metagenomics method to screen for the presence of cowpea viruses from plants collected from the three agro-climatic zones of Burkina Faso. Besides the three cowpea-infecting virus species which have previously been reported from Burkina Faso (Cowpea aphid borne mosaic virus [Family Potyviridae], the Blackeye cowpea mosaic virus-a strain of Bean common mosaic virus-[Family Potyviridae] and Cowpea mottle virus [Family Tombusviridae]) five additional viruses were identified: Southern cowpea mosaic virus (Sobemovirus genus), two previously uncharacterised polerovirus-like species (Family Luteoviridae), a previously uncharacterised tombusvirus-like species (Family Tombusviridae) and a previously uncharacterised mycotymovirus-like species (Family Tymoviridae). Overall, potyviruses were the most prevalent cowpea viruses (detected in 65.5% of samples) and the Southern Sudan zone of Burkina Faso was found to harbour the greatest degrees of viral diversity and viral prevalence. Partial genome sequences of the two novel polerovirus-like and tombusvirus-like species were determined and RT-PCR primers were designed for use in Burkina Faso to routinely detect all of these cowpea-associated viruses."

Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is an essential component of PCVAD, although an etiologic role in PDNS is not well established. Here, a novel circovirus, designated porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3), was identified in sows that died acutely with PDNS-like clinical signs. The capsid and replicase proteins of PCV3 are only 37% and 55% identical to PCV2 and bat circoviruses, respectively. Aborted fetuses from sows with PDNS contained high levels of PCV3 (7.57 Ã 10 While porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) was first identified in sporadic cases of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome in Canada in the early 1990s, an epidemic of severe systemic disease due to PCV2 spread worldwide in the ensuing decade. Despite being effectively controlled by commercial vaccines, PCV2 remains one of the most economically significant viruses of swine. Here, a novel porcine circovirus (PCV3) that is distantly related to known circoviruses was identified in sows with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) and reproductive failure. PCV2, which has previously been associated with these clinical presentations, was not identified. High levels of PCV3 nucleic acid were observed in aborted fetuses by quantitative PCR, and PCV3 antigen was localized in histologic lesions typical of PDNS in sows by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. PCV3 was also identified in archival PDNS diagnostic samples that previously tested negative for PCV2 by IHC analysis. The emergence of PCV3 warrants further investigation."

However, layer flocks in China have experienced outbreaks of this virus since 2008. To understand the genetic diversity of ALV-J in Chinese layers, we compared and analyzed the GP85 gene sequences of 106 ALV-J isolates that were isolated between 1999 and 2010 in Mainland China. The GP85 gene sequences of 41 layer isolates collected from 9 provinces of China between 2008 and 2010 belonged to two separate, highly diverse subgroups and were differentiated from meat-type chicken isolates. When compared to all meat-type isolates from China, Subgroup 1 exclusively contained current layer isolates and seemed to be dominant; all the isolates in this subgroup exhibited gene diversity, and many unique amino acid mutations were present. In contrast, the viruses in Subgroup 2 were perfectly conserved and shared high identity with the prototype meat-type chicken ALV-J strain HPRS-103. The two subgroups contained only two concurrent mutations at the same position. Moreover, most of the isolates in Subgroup 1 had two additional glycosylation sites (at positions 101 and 191) when compared with those in Subgroup 2. Our study provides evidence for the coexistence of two extremely different ALV-J subgroups in Chinese layers from 2008 to 2010, supporting the need for vaccine development and purification measures to prevent ALV-J infection in layers in China."

Reports suggested variable host response in goats and sheep and this host response vis-a-vis the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has not been investigated. Here, miRNAs were sequenced and proteomics data were generated to identify the role of differentially expressed miRNA (DEmiRNA) in PPR virus (PPRV) infected lung and spleen tissues of sheep and goats. In lungs, 67 and 37 DEmiRNAs have been identified in goats and sheep, respectively. Similarly, in spleen, 50 and 56 DEmiRNAs were identified in goats and sheep, respectively. A total of 20 and 11 miRNAs were found to be common differentially expressed in both the species in PPRV infected spleen and lung, respectively. Six DEmiRNAs-miR-21-3p, miR-1246, miR-27a-5p, miR-760-3p, miR-320a, and miR-363 were selected based on their role in viral infections, apoptosis, and fold change. The target prediction analysis of these six selected DEmiRNAs from the proteome data generated, revealed involvement of more number of genes in lung and spleen of goats than in sheep. On gene ontology analysis of host target genes these DEmiRNAs were found to regulate several immune response signaling pathways. It was observed that the pathways viz. T cell receptor signaling, Rap1 signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, and B cell receptor signaling governed by DEmiRNAs were more perturbed in goats than in sheep. The data suggests that PPRV-induced miR-21-3p, miR-320a, and miR-363 might act cooperatively to enhance viral pathogenesis in the lung and spleen of sheep by downregulating several immune response genes. The study gives an important insight into the molecular pathogenesis of PPR by identifying that the PPRV-Izatnagar/94 isolate elicits a strong host response in goats than in sheep."

Typhimurium is a broad host range serovar but has also evolved into host-adapted variants (i.e. isolated from a particular host such as pigeons). Six Typhimurium strains of different phage types (defined by patterns of susceptibility to lysis by a set of bacteriophages) were analysed using Illumina high-throughput genome sequencing. Variations between strains were mainly due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with an average of 611 SNPs per strain, ranging from 391 SNPs to 922 SNPs. There were seven insertions/deletions (indels) involving whole or partial gene deletions, four inactivation events due to IS200 insertion and 15 pseudogenes due to early termination. Four of these inactivated or deleted genes may be virulence related. Nine prophage or prophage remnants were identified in the six strains. Gifsy-1, Gifsy-2 and the sopE2 and sspH2 phage remnants were present in all six genomes while Fels-1, Fels-2, ST64B, ST104 and CP4-57 were variably present. Four strains carried the 90-kb plasmid pSLT which contains several known virulence genes. However, two strains were found to lack the plasmid. In addition, one strain had a novel plasmid similar to Typhi strain CT18 plasmid pHCM2. The genome data suggest that variations between strains were mainly due to accumulation of SNPs, some of which resulted in gene inactivation. Unique genetic elements that were common between host-adapted phage types were not found. This study advanced our understanding on the evolution and adaptation of Typhimurium at genomic level."

The family Astroviridae contains two genera, Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus, which â based upon our current knowledge â infect mammals and birds, respectively. However, recent seroprevalence study indicated that people with contact to turkeys can develop serological responses to the turkey astrovirus and minks might have been infected with the avastrovirus. These data suggest that the ""host species/astrovirus genus"" association should be permeable; however, mamastrovirus infection has not been reported from avian species, yet. In this study, a novel astrovirus was identified by viral metagenomics and RT-PCR methods in 2 (11%) out of 19 faecal samples collected from a wild, carnivorous bird species, European rollers (Coracias garrulus) from two breeding territories in Hungary. The complete genome sequence of astrovirus Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 (KP663426) was 7025 nt-long and had some unique genomic features including an unusually long spacer between the subgenomic RNA promoter and the ORF2 initiation codon. Using the BLASTp Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 had the highest aa identities 35%, 61% and 34% to MAstV 32 (JF713710, host: porcine), to MAstV 23 (JF729316, host: rabbit) and to unclassified porcine astrovirus (JX684071) in ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2, respectively. The same proteins of Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 had 25%, 66% and 33% aa identities to the corresponding proteins of murine astrovirus (JX544743) as the closest strain. The sequence- and phylogenetic analysis indicated that Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 represents the first member of a novel mamastrovirus species. Data suggest that both mammals and birds could have been exposed to mamastroviruses and avastroviruses providing opportunities for cross-species infection and viral adaptation with cross-class astroviruses especially in carnivorous animals. Further investigation is needed to determine the origin, natural host species spectrum, distribution and spread of Er/SZAL6/HUN/2011 among vertebrates."

Phylogenetic analysis was performed to further characterize the viruses and to evaluate species association and geographic patterns. Astroviruses were identified in samples from 86% of the chicken flocks and from 100% of the turkey flocks. Both chicken astrovirus and avian nephritis virus (ANV) were identified in chicken samples, and often both viruses were detected in the same flock. Turkey astrovirus type-2 and turkey astrovirus type-1 were found in 100% and 15.4% of the turkey flocks, respectively. In addition, 12.5% of turkey flocks were positive for ANV. Rotaviruses were present in 46.5% of the chicken flocks tested and in 69.7% of the turkey flocks tested. Based upon the rotavirus NSP4 gene sequence, the chicken and turkey origin rotaviruses assorted in a species-specific manner. The turkey origin rotaviruses also assorted based upon geographical location. Reoviruses were identified in 62.8% and 45.5% of chicken and turkey flocks, respectively. Based on the reovirus S4 gene segment, the chicken and turkey origin viruses assorted separately, and they were distinct from all previously reported avian reoviruses. Coronaviruses were detected in the intestinal contents of chickens, but not turkeys. Adenoviruses were not detected in any chicken or turkeys flocks. Of the 76 total chicken and turkey flocks tested, only three chicken flocks were negative for all viruses targeted by this study. Most flocks were positive for two or more of the viruses, and overall no clear pattern of virus geographic distribution was evident. This study provides updated enteric virus prevalence data for the United States using molecular methods, and it reinforces that enteric viruses are widespread in poultry throughout the United States, although the clinical importance of most of these viruses remains unclear."

The samples were screened for astrovirus, rotavirus, reovirus, and turkey coronavirus (TCoV) by a reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and for groups 1 and 2 adenovirus by PCR. Rotavirus was the only virus detected prior to placement (7 of 16 samples examined). All of the commercial flocks were positive for rotavirus and astrovirus from 2 until 6 wk of age, and most were intermittently positive until 12 wk of age, when the birds were processed. Of the 96 samples collected from birds on the farms, 89.5% were positive for astrovirus, and 67.7% were positive for rotavirus. All flocks were negative for TCoV, reovirus, and group 1 adenovirus at all time points, and positive for group 2 adenovirus (hemorrhagic enteritis virus) at 6 wk of age. All the flocks monitored were considered healthy or normal by field personnel. Turkeys placed on research facilities that had been empty for months and thoroughly cleaned had higher body weights and lower feed conversion rates at 5 wk of age when compared to turkeys placed on commercial farms. Intestinal samples collected at 1, 2, and 3 wk of age from these turkeys were free of enteric viruses. This report demonstrates that astroviruses and rotaviruses may be present within a turkey flock through the life of the flock. Comparison of infected birds with one group of turkeys that were negative for enteric viruses by the methods used here suggests that astrovirus and/or rotavirus may affect production. The full impact on flock performance needs to be further determined."

Phylogenetic analysis was performed with sequence data from the polymerase (ORF-1b) genes of 41 turkey-origin astroviruses and 23 chicken-origin astroviruses. All currently available avian astrovirus sequence data and selected mammalian astrovirus sequence data were included in the analysis. Four groups of avian astroviruses were observed by phylogenetic analysis: turkey astrovirus type 1 (TAstV-1)-like viruses, turkey astrovirus type 2 (TAstV-2)-like viruses, both detected in turkeys; avian nephritis virus (ANV)-like viruses, detected in both chickens and turkeys; and a novel group of chicken-origin astroviruses (CAstV). Among these four groups, amino acid identity was between 50.1% and 73.8%, and was a maximum of 49.4% for all avian isolates when compared with the mammalian astroviruses. There were multiple phylogenetic subgroups within the TAstV-2, ANV, and CAstV groups based on 9% nucleotide sequence divergence. Phylogenetic analysis revealed no clear assortment by geographic region or isolation date. Furthermore, no correlation was observed between the detection of a particular astrovirus and the presence of enteric disease or poor performance. Based on these data, a revision of the present taxonomic classification for avian astroviruses within the genus Avastrovirus is warranted."

Because the antigenic match between vaccine and circulating strains was good in both of these seasons, a relevant proportion of cases may have been prevented by vaccination. A different situation was observed during the 2011-2012 season, when ILI morbidity rates in individuals â¥65-y-of-age were 1.5-6-fold higher than those registered during the other epidemics under review. The higher morbidity resulted from the circulation during the 2011-2012 season of an A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2)-like variant that presented a reduced genetic match with the A(H3N2) strain included in the 2011-2012 vaccine composition. The continuous surveillance of the characteristics of circulating viruses is an essential tool for monitoring their matching with seasonal vaccine strains.

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed for the detection of this serogroup and used to identify and determine partial sequence data for other isolates of the virus.

Here we aim to characterize the causative agent of visceral gout suspected for astrovirus infection in broiler breeder chickens. Total RNA isolated from allantoic fluid of SPF embryo passaged with infected chicken sample was sequenced by whole genome shotgun sequencing using ion-torrent PGM platform. The sequence was analysed for the presence of coding and non-coding features, its similarity with reported isolates and epitope analysis of capsid structural protein. The consensus length of 7513Â bp genome sequence of Indian isolate of chicken astrovirus was obtained after assembly of 14,121 high quality reads. The genome was comprised of 13Â bp 5'-UTR, three open reading frames (ORFs) including ORF1a encoding serine protease, ORF1b encoding RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and ORF2 encoding capsid protein, and 298Â bp of 3'-UTR which harboured two corona virus stem loop II like ""s2m"" motifs and a poly A stretch of 19 nucleotides. The genetic analysis of CAstV/INDIA/ANAND/2016 suggested highest sequence similarity of 86.94% with the chicken astrovirus isolate CAstV/GA2011 followed by 84.76% with CAstV/4175 and 74.48%% with CAstV/Poland/G059/2014 isolates.

Although both viruses may cause febrile rhinopneumonitis, EHV-1 is the main cause of abortions, paresis and neonatal foal deaths. The lesion central to these three conditions is necrotising vasculitis and thrombosis resulting from lytic infection of endothelial cells lining blood capillaries. The initiation of infection in these lesions is likely to be by reactivated EHV-1 from latently infected leukocytes. However, host factors responsible for reactivation remain poorly understood. While vaccine development against these important viruses of equines involving classical and modern approaches has been ongoing for over five decades, progress, compared to other alpha herpesviruses of veterinary importance affecting cattle and pigs, has been slow.

Although intolerable to modern high-production livestock systems, the disease is not usually fatal and often not a priority for control in many developing countries, which remain reservoirs for viral dissemination. Phylogenetic analysis of the viruses circulating worldwide reveals seven principal reservoirs, each requiring a tailored regional control strategy. Considerable trade benefits accrue to countries that eradicate the disease but as well as requiring regional cooperation, achieving and maintaining this status using current tools takes a great deal of time, money and effort. Therefore, a progressive approach is needed that can provide interim benefits along the pathway to final eradication. Research is needed to understand and predict the patterns of viral persistence and emergence and to improve vaccine selection. Better diagnostic methods and especially better vaccines could significantly improve control in both the free and the affected parts of the world. In particular, vaccines with improved thermostability and a longer duration of immunity would facilitate control and make it less reliant on advanced veterinary infrastructures."

One isolate from the neighbouring country Nepal was also included in the study. The virus/ field strains showed high degree of genetic heterogeneity among themselves with % divergence in nucleotide sequence ranging from 1.2 to 19.4%. The Indian strains were much away (13.3 20.6%) from the exotic type O strains of O1BFS, O1K, and O1Campos. The type O strains analyzed were classified into three genotypes basing on level of divergence observed in nucleotide sequence. The type O vaccine virus (R2/75) was > 71% divergent (7.3-15.2%) from the field strains which revealed significant ( > 5%) genetic heterogeneity between the two. The phylogenetic analysis identified three distinct lineages, viz., (i) lineage 1 represented by the exotic strains, (ii) lineage 2 represented by 25 of the field strains which clustered into seven subgroups/sublines (2a-2g), and (iii) lineage 3 represented by a unique field isolate which shared the branching/origin with the vaccine strain. The lineage 2 which comprised of 25 of the 26 type O field strains analyzed, was placed almost at equidistance from the lineages 1 and 3 in the phylogenetic tree. The vaccine strain was closer to the viruses in lineage 2. Though there was no specific distribution pattern of sequences in different geographical regions of India, the viruses/ sequences in subgroup 2f appeared to be restricted to the southern states. Comparison of deduced amino acid sequence in the immunodominant regions 133-160 and 200-208 of the 1D gene product (VP1) showed that the two viruses in lineage 3 had unique amino acid residues at the positions 138 (D), 139 (G), 144 (I), and 158 (A) compared to rest of the strains including the exotic ones. Comparison of amino acid residues at critical positions 144, 148, 149, 151, 153, 154, and 208 revealed similarity between the type O strains analyzed. The virus strains showed variation (V/L/I) at position 144. One field strain showed replacement from Q149-->E and another from P208-->L. Thus, the study revealed that the type O FMD virus populations circulating in India and causing disease outbreaks are genetically much heterogeneous but related at the immunodominant region of VP1 polypeptide, and there are more than one genetically distinct virus populations in almost every region of the country which is possible due to unrestricted animal movement in the country. The involvement of vaccine virus in disease outbreaks was ruled out as the field strains (excluding the one in lineage 3) were phylogenetically distinct from it."

Cluster analysis based on either serological relatedness, as inferred from virus neutralization and complement fixation assays, or nucleotide sequences of two separate genes (phosphoprotein or glycoprotein) grouped the field isolates into two distinct monophyletic groups within the Indiana serogroup. One group included seven viruses from Brazil and Argentina that were serologically classified as Indiana-2 and Cocal virus (COCV). The other group contained three viruses from Brazil that were serologically classified as Indiana-3 and the prototype of this group, Alagoas virus (VSAV). Interestingly, two vesiculoviruses that were isolated from insects but do not cause disease in animals, one from Brazil (Maraba virus; MARAV) and the other from Colombia (CoAr 171638), grouped into two separate genetic lineages within the Indiana serotype. Our data provide support for the classification of viruses causing clinical VS in livestock in Brazil and Argentina into two distinct groups: Indiana-2 (VSIV-2) and Indiana-3 (VSIV-3). We suggest using nomenclature for these viruses that includes the serotype, year and place of occurrence, and affected host. This nomenclature is consistent with that currently utilized to describe field isolates of VSNJV or VSIV in scientific literature."

It is a global priority to discover its origin and the point in time at which it will become transmittable between humans. We present here an interdisciplinary method to track the origin of H7N9 virus in China and to establish an evolutionary dynamics model for its human-to-human transmission via mutations. After comparing influenza viruses from China since 1983, we established an A/H7N9/2013_China virus evolutionary phylogenetic tree and found that the human instances of virus infection were of avian origin and clustered into an independent line. Comparing hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene sequences of A/H7N9/2013_China viruses with all human-to-human, avian, and swine influenza viruses in China in the past 30 years, we found that A/H7N9/2013_China viruses originated from Baer's Pochard H7N1 virus of Hu Nan Province 2010 (HA gene, EPI: 370846, similarity with H7N9 is 95.5%) and duck influenza viruses of Nanchang city 2000 (NA gene, EPI: 387555, similarity with H7N9 is 97%) through genetic re-assortment. HA and NA gene sequence comparison indicated that A/H7N9/2013_China virus was not similar to human-to-human transmittable influenza viruses. To simulate the evolution dynamics required for human-to-human transmission mutations of H7N9 virus, we employed the Markov model.

Extensive surveillance in wild birds was carried out in Argentina during 2006-2007. Using RRT-PCR, 12 AI positive detections were made from cloacal swabs. One of those positive samples yielded an AI virus isolated from a wild kelp gull (Larus dominicanus) captured in the South Atlantic coastline of Argentina. Further characterization by nucleotide sequencing reveals that it belongs to the H13N9 subtype. Phylogenetic analysis of the 8 viral genes suggests that the 6 internal genes are related to the isolates from Chile and Bolivia.

These data support genotypes 3 and 4 having zoonotic nature. The diagnosis of this disease is based in the detection of anti-HEV IgG and IgM in blood serum using enzyme-linked immunosorbent methods. However, the method that best confirms the diagnosis is the RT-PCR, which detects HEV RNA in blood serum and also provides the genotype. The clinical course is generally that of an acute hepatitis which in some cases may require hospitalization and that, in transplant patients or HIV infected individuals can become a chronic hepatitis. Furthermore, the virus constitutes an important risk for pregnant women. The hepatitis E can present a wide range of symptoms, from a subclinical case to chronic liver disease with extrahepatic manifestations. For this reason, the diagnostic is challenging if no differential diagnosis is included. There is no specific antiviral drug for hepatitis E, but satisfactory results have been observed in some patients treated with pegylated interferon alfa2a and/or ribavirin. This revision is an update of all the molecular, epidemiological, clinic and preventive knowledge on this emergent disease up to date."

In March 2006 an avian H5N1 influenza A virus was isolated from poultry in Israel. In the present study we molecularly characterized the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of eleven H5N1 viruses isolated from domestic poultry in Israel and Gaza in March-April 2006. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA and NA genes showed that the Israeli and Gazian viruses were closely related to viruses isolated in Egypt in 2006."

A total of more than 500 isolations from turkeys and chickens were registered during the outbreaks. The present study has revealed some genetic peculiarities among the local isolates, namely: all the isolates belong to the same G1-like phylogenetic lineage, within which they form a single group, which, in turn, is divided into three subgroups in the cases of the HA and NP genes, and two subgroups in the case of the NA gene. The results present a basis for suggesting the existence of two parallel evolutionary trends originating from the same local ""prototype"" isolate."

In this report, virulent NDVs isolated in Mexico between 1998 and 2006 were subjected to biologic characterization, using standard pathogenicity tests, and to phylogenetic analysis. Chicken embryo mean death time (MDT) test results ranged from 39.7 to 61.5 hours, and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) values were between 1.59 and 1.94, compared to a possible maximum value of 2.0. These isolates showed a dibasic amino acid motif at the fusion protein cleavage site sequence required for host systemic replication. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Mexican virulent NDVs belong to the class II, genotype V viruses and can be clearly divided in two groups as follows: isolates from 1998 to 2001 with close epidemiologic relationship with the latest U.S. NDV outbreaks, and phylogenetically distinct viruses, isolated from 2004 to 2006, which showed higher virulence. The assessment of the evolution of viruses from Mexico and other neighboring countries will aid in the U.S surveillance efforts for early detection of highly virulent NDV."

After infection by this peripheral route, two types of viruses could be classified according to their effects: 1) pathogenic viruses, including fixed rabies Pasteur virus (serogenotype 1) and wild viruses belonging to serogenotype 1 (from a rabid fox in France and from a cow infected by a vampire bat in Brazil) or to serogenotype 5 (European bat lyssavirus 1); and 2) non-pathogenic viruses, including Mokola virus (serogenotype 3). RTC was tested by analysing in vitro the capacity of splenic T cells from infected BALB/c mice to produce cytokines after antigenic (purified lyssavirus antigens) or polyclonal stimulation (concanavalin A). Cytokine production was followed by assaying the biological activity of interleukin-2 and by testing for interleukin-2, interleukin-4 and interferon-gamma (IL2, IL4 and IFN gamma ) messenger RNAs (mRNA) by transcription into complementary DNA and amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. The initial biologically active IL2 and cytokine mRNA production was observed in mice infected with pathogenic or non-pathogenic lyssaviruses. Only mice with symptoms (infected with pathogenic viruses) lost the capacity to produce cytokines in vitro after antigen-specific stimulation. No such loss was observed after polyclonal stimulation. In mice peripherally infected with non-pathogenic viruses, no loss was observed after stimulation with lyssavirus antigens. Thus, infection with pathogenic lyssaviruses by the peripheral route induces in BALB/c mice a loss of T-cell responsiveness after antigen activation, but not after polyclonal activation."

In the human immunodeficiency lentivirus 1 (HIV-1), dynamic G4s are located in the unique viral LTR promoter. Folding of HIV-1 LTR G4s inhibits viral transcription; stabilization by G4 ligands intensifies this effect. Cellular proteins modulate viral transcription by inducing/unfolding LTR G4s. We here expanded our investigation on the presence of LTR G4s to all lentiviruses. G4s in the 5'-LTR U3 region were completely conserved in primate lentiviruses. A G4 was also present in a cattle-infecting lentivirus. All other non-primate lentiviruses displayed hints of less stable G4s. In primate lentiviruses, the possibility to fold into G4s was highly conserved among strains. LTR G4 sequences were very similar among phylogenetically related primate viruses, while they increasingly differed in viruses that diverged early from a common ancestor. A strong correlation between primate lentivirus LTR G4s and Sp1/NFÎºB binding sites was found. All LTR G4s folded: their complexity was assessed by polymerase stop assay. Our data support a role of the lentiviruses 5'-LTR G4 region as control centre of viral transcription, where folding/unfolding of G4s and multiple recruitment of factors based on both sequence and structure may take place."

Enhancing MD genetic resistance is desirable to augment current vaccines and other MD control measures. High throughput sequencing was used to profile splenic transcriptomes from individual F1 progeny infected with MDV at 4 days of age from both outbred broilers (meat-type) and inbred layer (egg-type) chicken lines that differed in MD genetic resistance. The resulting information was used to identify SNPs, genes, and biological pathways exhibiting allele-specific expression (ASE) in response to MDV infection in each type of chicken. In addition, we compared and contrasted the results of pathway analyses (ASE and differential expression (DE)) between chicken types to help inform on the biological response to MDV infection. With 7 individuals per line and treatment group providing high power, we identified 6,132 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 4,768 genes and 4,528 SNPs in 3,718 genes in broilers and layers, respectively, that exhibited ASE in response to MDV infection. Furthermore, 548 and 434 genes in broilers and layers, respectively, were found to show DE following MDV infection. Comparing the datasets, only 72 SNPs and 850 genes for ASE and 20 genes for DE were common between the two bird types. Although the chicken types used in this study were genetically different, at the pathway level, both TLR receptor and JAK/STAT signaling pathways were enriched as well as exhibiting a high proportion of ASE genes, especially at the beginning of both above mentioned regulatory pathways. RNA sequencing with adequate biological replicates is a powerful approach to identify high confidence SNPs, genes, and pathways that are associated with transcriptional response to MDV infection. In addition, the SNPs exhibiting ASE in response to MDV infection provide a strong foundation for determining the extent to which variation in expression influences MD incidence plus yield genetic markers for genomic selection. However, given the paucity of overlap among ASE SNP sets (broilers vs. layers), it is likely that separate screens need to be incorporated for each population. Finally, comparison of gene lists obtained between these two diverse chicken types indicate the TLR and JAK/STAT signaling are conserved when responding to MDV infection and may be altered by selection of genes exhibiting ASE found at the start of each pathway."

Hepatitis C virus infection causes acute and chronic liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In fact, hepatitis C virus infection is the most frequent indication for liver transplantation and a vaccine is not available. Hepatitis C virus displays a narrow host species tropism, naturally infecting only humans, although chimpanzees are also susceptible to experimental infection. To date, there is no evidence for an animal reservoir of viruses closely related to hepatitis C virus which may have crossed the species barrier to cause disease in humans and resulted in the current pandemic. In fact, due to this restricted host range, a robust immunocompetent small animal model is still lacking, hampering mechanistic analysis of virus pathogenesis, immune control and prophylactic vaccine development. Recently, several studies discovered new viruses related to hepatitis C virus, belonging to the hepaci- and pegivirus genera, in small wild mammals (rodents and bats) and domesticated animals which live in close contact with humans (dogs and horses). Genetic and biological characterization of these newly discovered hepatitis C virus-like viruses infecting different mammals will contribute to our understanding of the origins of hepatitis C virus in humans and enhance our ability to study pathogenesis and immune responses using tractable animal models. In this review article, we start with an introduction on the genetic diversity of hepatitis C virus and then focus on the newly discovered viruses closely related to hepatitis C virus. Finally, we discuss possible theories about the origin of this important viral human pathogen."

Neuropathological examination of the brain and spinal cord detected non-suppurative polioencephalomyelitis and dorsal root ganglionitis, characteristic of a neurotropic viral agent in both sheep. Metagenomic analysis of different tissue samples from both animals identified a novel Ovine Astrovirus (OvAstV). The presence of viral genome in the central nervous system was confirmed by RT-qPCR. Although the cases presented nine months apart, the identified OvAstV shared nearly identical sequences, differing in only three nucleotide positions across the complete genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relation of OvAstV to neurotropic bovine astroviruses and an enteric OvAstV. In conclusion, these are the first reported cases of astrovirus infection in domestic sheep that were associated with encephalitis and ganglionitis."

Recently, full genome sequences of wild-type and vaccine strains have been determined worldwide, but none was from Europe. The aim of this study was to determine and analyse the complete genome sequences of five ILTV strains. Sequences were also compared to reveal the similarity of strains across time and to discriminate between wild-type and vaccine strains. Genomes of three ILTV field isolates from outbreaks occurred in Italy in 1980, 2007 and 2011, and two commercial chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccines were sequenced using the 454 Life Sciences technology. The comparison with the Serva genome showed that 35 open reading frames (ORFs) differed across the five genomes. Overall, 54 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 27 amino acid differences in 19 ORFs and two insertions in the UL52 and ORFC genes were identified. Similarity among the field strains and between the field and the vaccine strains ranged from 99.96% to 99.99%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship among them, as well. This study generated data on genomic variation among Italian ILTV strains revealing that, even though the genetic variability of the genome is well conserved across time and between wild-type and vaccine strains, some mutations may help in differentiating among them and may be involved in ILTV virulence/attenuation.

Interspecies transmission between livestock, domestic animals and humans is commonly observed, but spread of animal-like rotaviruses within the human population is limited. During the continued monitoring of rotavirus strains in Germany, an unusual G6P[9] rotavirus strain was detected in feces of a child. The complete rotavirus coding sequences revealed a unique G6-P[9]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T3-E2-H3 genotype constellation. The virus was phylogenetically related to feline G3P[9] strains and other human G6P[9] rotaviruses of presumable zoonotic origin.

Moreover, substantial deficits of conventional semi-nested PCR genotyping approaches in detecting contemporary G6P[9] were revealed.

This study performed genomic sequence analysis of 11 avian influenza isolates from 1956 to 1979 for comparison with A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9). Phylogenetic and genetic analyses included these viruses in combination with all known full-genome sequences of avian viruses isolated before 1981. It was shown that a low-pathogenic avian influenza virus, A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1), that had been isolated 3 months previously, was the closest known genetic relative with six genome segments of common lineage encoding the polymerase subunits PB2, PB1 and PA, nucleoprotein (NP), haemagglutinin (HA) and non-structural (NS) proteins. The lineages of these genome segments included reassortment with other North American turkey viruses that were all rooted in North American wild waterfowl with the HA gene originating from the H5N2 serotype. The phylogenies demonstrated adaptation from North American wild birds to turkeys with the possible involvement of domestic waterfowl. The turkey isolate, A/turkey/Wisconsin/1968 (H5N9), was the second most closely related poultry isolate to A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9), possessing five common lineage genome segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA and neuraminidase). The A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1) virus was more virulent than A/turkey/Wisconsin/68 (H5N9) for chicken embryos and mice, indicating a greater biological similarity to A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9). Thus, A/turkey/Ontario/6213/1966 (H5N1) was identified as the closest known ancestral relative of HPAI A/turkey/Ontario/7732/1966 (H5N9), which will serve as a useful reference virus for characterizing the early genetic and biological properties associated with the emergence of pathogenic avian influenza strains."

This novel ddPCR format offers a simple workflow capable of generating highly stable partitioning of DNA molecules. In this study, we assessed key performance parameters of the ddPCR system. A linear ddPCR response to DNA concentration was obtained from 0.16% through to 99.6% saturation in a 20,000 droplet assay corresponding to more than 4 orders of magnitude of target DNA copy number per ddPCR. Analysis of simplex and duplex assays targeting two distinct loci in the Lambda DNA genome using the ddPCR platform agreed, within their expanded uncertainties, with values obtained using a lower density microfluidic chamber based digital PCR (cdPCR). A relative expanded uncertainty under 5% was achieved for copy number concentration using ddPCR. This level of uncertainty is much lower than values typically observed for quantification of specific DNA target sequences using currently commercially available real-time and digital cdPCR technologies."

This collection implies the use of a panel of cell lines originating from various animal species. In order to make easier the handling of such a large panel of cell lines, wide spectrum real-time PCR and RT-PCR assays were developed to allow the detection and the quantification of DNA and mRNA of Î²-actin, one of the most commonly used eukaryotic housekeeping genes. By using two degenerated primers and a unique probe, these two assays were shown to detect nucleic acids of a panel of vertebrate and invertebrate cell lines commonly used in animal virology. This panel included human, monkey, rodent, dog, pig, fish, batrachian, mosquito and tick cell lines. Additionally, the two assays amplified successfully Î²-actin-encoding sequences of sandflies. Sensitivity evaluation performed on synthetic DNA and RNA sequences showed that the two assays were very sensitive and suitable for accurate quantification. The two assays constitute together a convenient method suitable for multiple purposes. They can be used for instance to estimate the amount of contaminating cellular genetic material prior to sequence-independent amplification of viral genomes achieved before high-throughput sequencing, to evaluate the efficiency of DNase and/or RNase treatments performed on cellular extract and to check nucleic acid extraction by using Î²-actin-encoding sequences as endogenous control. This assay will constitute a precious tool for virologists working with multiple cell lines or animal models."

A pestivirus was hypothesized to be the cause of this emerging disease and this type of virus can cross the species barrier and be transmitted to or from wildlife. Using an epidemiological survey conducted from 1995 to 2004 at Orlu, France, we characterized the virus and analyzed its transmission. A phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences and virus neutralization tests showed that the virus belonged to the newly described border disease virus-4 group. The increase of seroprevalence with age indicated that infection can occur at any age and resulted in lifelong immunity. Overall, 70.3% of 323 samples were positive for anti-p80 antibodies and 10.2% of 167 samples showed viremia, as demonstrated by either positive ELISA antigen test or RT-PCR. Infection has thus been widespread in this population since 1995, whereas no mass mortality or clinical signs have been observed. Incidence and seroprevalence varied seasonally and according to number of individuals aged less than 2 years old in the population, so viral transmission was dependent on host population age structure. We propose that the virus is now endemic in this population and is likely detrimental for reproduction and juveniles. Further investigation is needed to estimate the impact of pestivirus on host population dynamics and the risk of cross-transmission to farm animals."

However, since the emergence of the human pandemic pdmH1N1 virus in 2009, which has been (re)introduced into individual swine herds worldwide, the situation has been changing. These variations in the respective IAV pools within pig populations are of major interest, and the zoonotic potential of putative emerging viruses needs to be evaluated. As data on recent IAV in swine from southern Germany were relatively sparse, the purpose of this study was to determine the major IAV subtypes actually present in this region. To this aim, from 2010 to 2013, 1417 nasal swabs or lung tissue samples from pigs with respiratory disease were screened for IAV genomes. Overall, in 130 holdings IAV genomes were detected by real-time RT-PCR targeting the matrix protein gene. For further analyses, several PCR protocols were adapted to quickly subtype between H1, pdmH1, H3, N1 and N2 sequences. Taken together, cocirculation of the three stable European lineages of IAV was confirmed for Bavaria. H1N1 sequences were identified in 59, whereas H1N2 genomes were only diagnosed in 14, and H3N2 in 9 of the holdings analysed. However, pdmH1 in combination with N1 was detected in 2010, 2012 and 2013 confirming a presence, albeit in low prevalence, likewise pdmH1N2 reassortant viruses. Interestingly, individual cases of coinfections with more than one subtype were diagnosed. Partial genome sequences were determined and phylogenetic analyses performed. Clearly other than in the human population classically circulating IAV have not been displaced by pdmH1N1 in Bavarian swine. However, some interesting viruses were detected. Further surveillance of these viruses in the Bavarian pig population will be of major importance, to monitor future developments."

However, the key issue of viral persistence in swine populations at different scales is ill understood. We address this gap using epidemiological models calibrated against seroprevalence data from Dutch finishing pigs to estimate the 'critical herd size' (CHS) for IAV persistence. We then examine the viral phylogenetic evidence for persistence by comparing human and swine IAV. Models suggest a CHS of approximately 3000 pigs above which influenza was likely to persist, i.e. orders of magnitude lower than persistence thresholds for IAV and other acute viruses in humans. At national and regional scales, we found much stronger empirical signatures of prolonged persistence of IAV in swine compared with human populations. These striking levels of persistence in small populations are driven by the high recruitment rate of susceptible piglets, and have significant implications for management of swine and for overall patterns of genetic diversity of IAV."

The purpose of the study was to determine the BVDV infection status in a dairy herd vaccinated against BVD. Before vaccination started in 2008, there had been no prior identification or the removal of the possible source of infection (persistently infected animals). It was expected that vaccination itself would enable the elimination of viral shedders on a long term basis. Material and Methods: Serological screening for antibodies against BVDV with determination for antibodies titres, BVDV antigen, and the presence of the viral genome with phylogenetic analysis of positive samples in the herd were performed, despite the lack of any clinical problems indicating possible presence of BVDV infection. Results: 19 individuals persistently infected with BVDV were identified among calves and heifers but not in adult cattle. All virus shedders were antibody negative and the genotype of isolated virus was BVDV-1b, indicating a single source of infection. The vaccine used in the herd was composed of BVDV-1a strain. In each of the tested cowsheds, antibody titres against BVDV-1b were higher than against BVDV-1a (median values). Conclusion: Despite a long-lasting vaccination programme and relatively high sequence homology of vaccinal and field strains of BVDV (83.6%), it was not possible to avoid transplacental infections of foetuses and the birth of persistently infected calves from vaccinated heifers although the protection against clinical disease was accomplished.</jats:p>"

Using TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay, we analyzed the presence of RNA HEV in 45 liver samples and five spleen samples collected from 50 wild boars. Samples were collected during the 2013-2015 hunting seasons. Nine samples of 50 were tested positive for HEV RNA, resulting an overall prevalence of 18%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolates clustered in different HEV-3 monophyletic groups, depending on the sampling county. This is the first study signalling, based on molecular analysis, the presence of HEV in wild boar population from Romania.

To study differences in disease development between HPAIV and LPAIV, we examined the first appearance and eventual load of viral RNA in multiple organs as well as host responses in brain and intestine of chickens infected with two closely related H7N1 HPAIV or LPAIV strains. Both H7N1 HPAIV and LPAIV spread systemically in chickens after a combined intranasal/intratracheal inoculation. In brain, large differences in viral RNA load and host gene expression were found between H7N1 HPAIV and LPAIV infected chickens. Chicken embryo brain cell culture studies revealed that both HPAIV and LPAIV could infect cultivated embryonic brain cells, but in accordance with the absence of the necessary proteases, replication of LPAIV was limited. Furthermore, TUNEL assay indicated apoptosis in brain of HPAIV infected chickens only. In intestine, where endoproteases that cleave HA of LPAIV are available, we found minimal differences in the amount of viral RNA and a large overlap in the transcriptional responses between HPAIV and LPAIV infected chickens. Interestingly, brain and ileum differed clearly in the cellular pathways that were regulated upon an AI infection. Although both H7N1 HPAIV and LPAIV RNA was detected in a broad range of tissues beyond the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, our observations indicate that differences in pathogenicity and mortality between HPAIV and LPAIV could originate from differences in virus replication and the resulting host responses in vital organs like the brain."

Serologic surveillance has potential advantages which have not been realized because rapid and specific serologic tests to detect H5N1 infection are not widely available. Here we describe an epitope-blocking ELISA to detect specific antibodies to H5N1 viruses in human or animal sera. The assay relies on a novel monoclonal antibody (5F8) that binds to an epitope comprising amino acid residues 274-281 (CNTKCQTP) in the HA1 region of H5 hemagglutinin. Database search analysis of publicly available sequences revealed that this epitope is conserved in 100% of the 163 H5N1 viruses isolated from humans. The sensitivity and specificity of the epitope-blocking ELISA for H5N1 were evaluated using chicken antisera to multiple virus clades and other influenza subtypes as well as serum samples from individuals naturally infected with H5N1 or seasonal influenza viruses. The epitope-blocking ELISA results were compared to those of hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) and microneutralization assays. Antibodies to H5N1 were readily detected in immunized animals or convalescent human sera by the epitope-blocking ELISA whereas specimens with antibodies to other influenza subtypes yielded negative results. The assay showed higher sensitivity and specificity as compared to HI and microneutralization. The epitope-blocking ELISA based on a unique 5F8 mAb provided highly sensitive and 100% specific detection of antibodies to H5N1 influenza viruses in human sera.

This is thought to be due mainly to sequence divergence in the large envelope protein and species-specific differences in host components essential for virus propagation. Here we report an infection of cranes with a novel hepadnavirus, designated CHBV, that has an unexpectedly broad host range and is only distantly evolutionarily related to avihepadnaviruses of related hosts. Direct DNA sequencing of amplified CHBV DNA as well a sequencing of cloned viral genomes revealed that CHBV is most closely related to, although distinct from, Ross' goose hepatitis B virus (RGHBV) and slightly less closely related to duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV). Phylogenetically, cranes are very distant from geese and ducks and are most closely related to herons and storks. Naturally occurring hepadnaviruses in the last two species are highly divergent in sequence from RGHBV and DHBV and do not infect ducks or do so only marginally. In contrast, CHBV from crane sera and recombinant CHBV produced from LMH cells infected primary duck hepatocytes almost as efficiently as DHBV did. This is the first report of a rather broad host range of an avihepadnavirus. Our data imply either usage of similar or identical entry pathways and receptors by DHBV and CHBV, unusual host and virus adaptation mechanisms, or divergent evolution of the host genomes and cellular components required for virus propagation."

Sixty pigs, 4-5 months of age, on a swine herd in Japan had detectable anti-HEV IgG antibodies, and five (8.3%) of them had ongoing infection of genotype 3 HEV. Five HEV strains obtained from the viremic pigs shared 98.8-100% nucleotide identity, and one representative strain (swHE1606845), whose entire genomic sequence was determined in this study, differed by 14.1-19.6% from the reported HEV strains of subtypes 3a-3k and by 14.7-19.1% from other genotype 3 HEV strains whose subtypes have not yet been assigned. swHE1606845 showed a higher nucleotide p-distance value of â¥0.143 with the genotype 3 HEV strains of subtypes 3a-3k and â¥0.152 with other genotype 3 strains of unassigned subtypes. A SimPlot analysis revealed a lack of recombination events. These results indicate that swHE1606845 is a candidate member of a novel subtype of genotype 3. Further efforts to identify the swHE1606845-like novel strain are warranted to clarify the origin of this strain and to determine the complete nucleotide sequences of two additional swHE1606845-like strains for assigning a new subtype."

In 2005, an unprecedented epizootic at Qinghai Lake killed more than 6000 migratory birds including over 3000 bar-headed geese (Anser indicus). H5N1 subsequently spread to Europe and Africa, and in following years has re-emerged in wild birds along the Central Asia flyway several times. To better understand the potential involvement of wild birds in the spread of H5N1, we studied the movements of bar-headed geese marked with GPS satellite transmitters at Qinghai Lake in relation to virus outbreaks and disease risk factors. We discovered a previously undocumented migratory pathway between Qinghai Lake and the Lhasa Valley of Tibet where 93% of the 29 marked geese overwintered. From 2003-2009, sixteen outbreaks in poultry or wild birds were confirmed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the majority were located within the migratory pathway of the geese. Spatial and temporal concordance between goose movements and three potential H5N1 virus sources (poultry farms, a captive bar-headed goose facility, and H5N1 outbreak locations) indicated ample opportunities existed for virus spillover and infection of migratory geese on the wintering grounds. Their potential as a vector of H5N1 was supported by rapid migration movements of some geese and genetic relatedness of H5N1 virus isolated from geese in Tibet and Qinghai Lake. This is the first study to compare phylogenetics of the virus with spatial ecology of its host, and the combined results suggest that wild birds play a role in the spread of H5N1 in this region. However, the strength of the evidence would be improved with additional sequences from both poultry and wild birds on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau where H5N1 has a clear stronghold."

Here we use an innovative combination of ornithological, phylogenetic and immunological approaches to investigate the ecology and age structure of HP H5N1 in nature. We screened samples from swans and waterbirds using PCR and sequenced HP H5N1-positive samples. The outbreak's origin was investigated by linking bird count data with a molecular clock analysis of sampled virus sequences. We used ringing records to reconstruct the age-structure of outbreak mortality, and we estimated the age distribution of prior exposure to avian influenza. Outbreak mortality was low and all HP H5N1-positive mute swans in the affected population were &lt;3 years old. Only the youngest age classes contained an appreciable number of individuals with no detectable antibody responses to viral nucleoprotein. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the outbreak strain circulated locally for â¼1 month before detection and arrived when the immigration rate of migrant waterbirds was highest. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that HP H5N1 epizootics in wild swans exhibit limited mortality due to immune protection arising from previous exposure. Our study population may represent a valuable resource for investigating the natural ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza.</jats:p>"

While many genotypes of H5N1 virus can be found in chicken, few are associated with the infection of mammals. Characterization of the genotypes of viral strains in animal populations is important to understand the distribution of different viral strains in various hosts. This also facilitates the surveillance and detection of possible emergence of highly pathogenic strains of specific genotypes from unknown hosts or hosts that have not been previously reported to carry these genotypes. Two H5N1 isolates were obtained from lung samples of two raccoon dogs that had died from respiratory disease in China. Pathogenicity experiments showed that the isolates were highly pathogenic to chicken. To characterize the genotypes of these viruses, their genomic sequences were determined and analyzed. The genetic contents of these isolates are virtually identical and they may come from the same progenitor virus. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the isolates were genetically closely related to genotype V H5N1 virus, which was first isolated in China in 2003, and were distinct from the dominant virus genotypes (e.g. genotype Z) of recent years. The isolates also contain a multibasic amino acid motif at their HA cleavage sites and have an E residue at position 627 of the PB2 protein similar to the previously-identified avian viruses. This is the first report that genotype V H5N1 virus is found to be associated with a mammalian host. Our results strongly suggest that genotype V H5N1 virus has the ability to cross species barriers to infect mammalian animals. These findings further highlight the risk that avian influenza H5N1 virus poses to mammals and humans, which may be infected by specific genotypes that are not known to infect these hosts."

Each of the eight genes of the isolates was most closely related to the corresponding gene from the classical swine H1N1 virus. Also, phylogenetic analysis further confirmed that each of the eight genes of the isolates was closely related to the classical swine H1N1 viruses, especially those isolated in China. The HA1 proteins of the three isolates were identical to that of A/Swine/Guangdong/ 1/01, a virus isolated in 2001 in China, even though three nucleotide differences were observed. These results further support the concept that swine can serve as a reservoir of genetically stable influenza viruses."

From a total of 28 million reads per sample, we identified 1,514 transcripts that were differentially expressed after infection. Both predicted and novel gene changes were detected, as were gene isoforms, and while many of the genes were expressed by all donors, some were unique. Knock-down of genes not previously known to be associated with WNV resistance identified their critical role in control of viral infection.

Such analyses will be valuable for translational studies of susceptible and resistant individuals--and for targeting therapeutics--in multiple biological settings."

Antigenic, morphologic, and biological characteristics of these two viruses were essentially similar to members of the family Paramyxoviridae. Antigenic analysis by indirect fluorescent antibody, immunoblot, and one-way cross-neutralization tests placed these viruses along with bovine parainfluenza 3 (BPIV3) viruses. Purified virions were 50-300 nm in size and morphologically indistinguishable from other paramyxoviruses. These two viruses hemagglutinated red blood cells and had neuraminidase activity. The gene junctions of fusion (F) and hemagglutinin (HN) glycoprotein genes of these viruses contained highly conserved transcription start and stop signal sequences and trinucleotide intergenic regions similar to other Paramyxoviridae. The F gene of ISU-92 was longer than Texas-81 due to insertion of a 24-nucleotide ""U""-rich 3' untranslated region. Structure-based sequence alignment of glycoproteins of these two SPMVs indicated that they are essentially similar in structure and function to parainfluenzaviruses. The Texas-81 strain was closely related to BPIV3 Shipping Fever (SF) strain at nucleotide and amino acid level, while the ISU-92 strain was more closely related to BPIV3 910N strain. The envelope glycoproteins of ISU-92 had only approximately 92 and approximately 96% identity at nucleotide and amino acid levels with BPIV3-SF strain, respectively. The high sequence identities to BPIV3 indicated cross-species infection in pigs. Phylogenetic analyses based on both F protein and HN protein suggested the classification of these viruses into the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, genus Respirovirus, and genotype A of BPIV3."

We report the discovery and characterization of a tick-borne virus--Jingmen tick virus (JMTV)--that reveals an unexpected connection between segmented and unsegmented RNA viruses. The JMTV genome comprises four segments, two of which are related to the nonstructural protein genes of the genus Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae), whereas the remaining segments are unique to this virus, have no known homologs, and contain a number of features indicative of structural protein genes. Remarkably, homology searching revealed that sequences related to JMTV were present in the cDNA library from Toxocara canis (dog roundworm; Nematoda), and that shared strong sequence and structural resemblances. Epidemiological studies showed that JMTV is distributed in tick populations across China, especially Rhipicephalus and Haemaphysalis spp., and experiences frequent host-switching and genomic reassortment. To our knowledge, JMTV is the first example of a segmented RNA virus with a genome derived in part from unsegmented viral ancestors."

A new divergence swine sublineage containing gene segments of 2009 H1N1 viruses was characterized, which were closely related with swine viruses collected from USA and South Korea during 2004 to 2007 in six segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP and NS), and to swine viruses isolated from Thailand during 2004 to 2005 in NA and M. Substitution rates were varied drastically among eight segments and the average substitution rate was generally higher in 2009 H1N1 than in swine and human viruses (F2,23 = 5.972, P < 0.01). Similarly, higher dN/dS substitution ratios were identified in 2009 H1N1 than in swine and human viruses except M2 gene (F2, 25 = 3.779, P < 0.05). The ages of 2009 H1N1 viruses were estimated around 0.1 to 0.5 year, while their common ancestors with closest related swine viruses existed between 9.3 and 17.37 years ago. Our results implied that at least four reassortments or transmissions probably occurred before 2009 H1N1 viruses. Initial reassortment arose in 1976 and avian-like Eurasian swine viruses emerged. The second transmission happened in Asia and North America between 1988 and 1992, and mostly influenced six segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP and NS). The third reassortment occurred between North American swine and avian viruses during 1998 to 2000, which involved PB2 and PA segments. Recent reassortments occurred among avian-to-swine reassortant, Eurasian and classical swine viruses during 2004 to 2005. South Korea, Thailand and USA, were identified as locations where reassortments most likely happened. The co-circulation of multiple swine sublineages and special lifestyle in Asia might have facilitated mixing of diverse influenza viruses, leading to generate a novel virus strain."

Milk, due to its high nutritional content, can support a rich microbiota. These microorganisms enter milk from a variety of sources and, once in milk, can play a number of roles, such as facilitating dairy fermentations (e.g. Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Propionibacterium and fungal populations), causing spoilage (e.g. Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Bacillus and other spore-forming or thermoduric microorganisms), promoting health (e.g. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) or causing disease (e.g. Listeria, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter and mycotoxin-producing fungi). There is also concern that the presence of antibiotic residues in milk leads to the development of resistance, particularly among pathogenic bacteria. Here, we comprehensively review these topics, while comparing the approaches, both culture-dependent and culture-independent, which can be taken to investigate the microbial composition of milk."

Colorimetric cell-viability assays are used for this purpose as long as the viruses are cytopathic (CP) in cell culture. However, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) strains circulating in the field are mostly non-cytopathic (NCP). An In Cell-ELISA aimed to measure viral infectivity by detecting a conserved protein produced during viral replication (non-structural protein 3, ""NS3"") was developed. The ELISA is performed without harvesting the cells, directly on the 96-wells culture plate. NS3 In Cell-ELISA was tested for its ability to assess BVDV-specific antiviral activity of recombinant bovine type I and III IFNs. Results correlated to those measured by qRT-PCR and virus titration. NS3 In Cell-ELISA was also efficient in estimating the IC50 of two compounds with different antiviral activity. Estimation of the 50% inhibition dose of each IFN using six BVDV strains of different biotype and genotype showed that CP strains were more susceptible to both IFNs than NCP, while type 2 NCP viruses were more sensitive to IFN-I. The In Cell-ELISA format using a detector antibody against a conserved non-structural protein can be potentially applied to accurately measure infectivity of any viral strain."

          <jats:p>
            Some life-threatening, foodborne, and zoonotic infections are transmitted through poultry birds. Inappropriate and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials in the livestock industry has led to an increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria with epidemic potential. Here, we present a functional molecular epidemiological analysis entailing the phenotypic and whole-genome sequence-based characterization of 11
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">H. pullorum</jats:named-content>
            isolates from broiler and free-range chickens sampled from retail wet markets in Hyderabad City, India. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed all of the isolates to be resistant to multiple antibiotic classes such as fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, and macrolides. The isolates were also found to be extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase producers and were even resistant to clavulanic acid. Whole-genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis of these isolates revealed the presence of five or six well-characterized antimicrobial resistance genes, including those encoding a resistance-nodulation-division efflux pump(s). Phylogenetic analysis combined with pan-genome analysis revealed a remarkable degree of genetic diversity among the isolates from free-range chickens; in contrast, a high degree of genetic similarity was observed among broiler chicken isolates. Comparative genomic analysis of all publicly available
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">H. pullorum</jats:named-content>
            genomes, including our isolates (

            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">H. pullorum</jats:named-content>
            -specific protein-encoding genes, with an average of 535 such genes per isolate.
            <jats:italic>In silico</jats:italic>
            virulence screening identified 182 important virulence genes and also revealed high strain-specific gene content in isolates from free-range chickens (average, 34) compared to broiler chicken isolates. A significant prevalence of prophages (ranging from 1 to 9) and a significant presence of genomic islands (0 to 4) were observed in free-range and broiler chicken isolates. Taken together, these observations provide significant baseline data for functional molecular infection epidemiology of nonpyloric

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Globally, the poultry industry is expanding with an ever-growing consumer base for chicken meat. Given this, food-associated transmission of multidrug-resistant bacteria represents an important health care issue. Our study involves a critical baseline approach directed at genome sequence-based epidemiology and transmission dynamics of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">H. pullorum</jats:named-content>
            , a poultry pathogen having established zoonotic potential. We believe our studies would facilitate the development of surveillance systems that ensure the safety of food for humans and guide public health policies related to the use of antibiotics in animal feed in countries such as India. We sequenced 11 new genomes of
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">H. pullorum</jats:named-content>
            as a part of this study. These genomes would provide much value in addition to the ongoing comparative genomic studies of helicobacters.

Our aim was to evaluate and review the effect of PBFD and its position as a key threatening process to Australian psittacine bird species. We review the origin/evolutionary pathways and potential threat of PBFD to endangered psittacine bird populations and captive-breeding flocks. The most recent beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) phylogenetic analyses indicate that all endangered Australian psittacine bird species are susceptible to, and equally likely to be infected by, BFDV genotypes from a range of host psittacine species. Management of the disease in captive-breeding programs has relied on testing and culling, which has proven costly. The risk of PBFD should be considered very carefully by management teams contemplating the establishment of captive-breeding flocks for endangered species. Alternative disease prevention tools, including vaccination, which are increasingly being used in wildlife health, should be considered more seriously for managing and preventing PBFD in captive flocks of critically endangered species."

The ORF designated tmp1 coding for 34 amino acids shared sequence similarity with putative holin-like toxin genes. To analyze the antibacterial activity of tmp1 encoded protein, this ORF was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The expressed gene product Tmp1 exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria but not to Gram-negative bacteria. A single transmembrane domain (TMD) was identified within Tmp1 and deletion analysis of the N-terminal region and TMD indicated TMD to be responsible for antibacterial activity. The TMD-dependent antibacterial activity was validated using a synthetic peptide with the amino acid sequence of TMD. Besides antibacterial activity, Tmp1 also complemented the function of holin in a lysis-defective bacteriophage lambda. To broaden the spectrum of antibacterial activity, a mutant library of tmp1 was generated by random mutagenesis. Four mutants with amino acid substitutions at the N-terminus of Tmp1 exhibited increased antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and were not hemolytic. An improved activity of these mutant proteins is attributed to their increased hydrophobicity."

Based on the restriction endonuclease fingerprinting of viral DNA, the BoHV1 can be divided into three subtypes viz., BoHV1.1, 1.2a, and 1.2b. Since this method requires a pure viral DNA, it is time-consuming and labour intense. In the current study, the UL0.5 gene based PCR sequencing has been used for the subtyping of BoHV1. Out of five isolates, four had BoHV1-like signatures and one isolate had BoHV1.2-like signatures. Further, these viruses phylogenetically clustered under the respective subtypes. These results indicate that the UL 0.5 gene based PCR sequencing could be used as an alternate method of subtyping of BoHV1."

Hence, gene reassortment of influenza A wild type (wt) viruses is performed with a highly egg adapted donor virus, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8), to provide the high yield reassortant (HYR) viral 'seeds' for vaccine production. HYR must contain the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of wt virus and one to six 'internal' genes from PR8. Most studies of influenza wt and HYRs have focused on the HA gene. The main objective of this study is the identification of the molecular signature in all eight gene segments of influenza A HYR candidate vaccine seeds associated with high growth in ovo. The genomes of 14 wt parental viruses, 23 HYRs (5 H1N1; 2, 1976 H1N1-SOIV; 2, 2009 H1N1pdm; 2 H2N2 and 12 H3N2) and PR8 were sequenced using the high-throughput sequencing pipeline with big dye terminator chemistry. Silent and coding mutations were found in all internal genes derived from PR8 with the exception of the M gene. The M gene derived from PR8 was invariant in all 23 HYRs underlining the critical role of PR8 M in high yield phenotype. None of the wt virus derived internal genes had any silent change(s) except the PB1 gene in X-157. The highest number of recurrent silent and coding mutations was found in NS. With respect to the surface antigens, the majority of HYRs had coding mutations in HA; only 2 HYRs had coding mutations in NA. In the era of application of reverse genetics to alter influenza A virus genomes, the mutations identified in the HYR gene segments associated with high growth in ovo may be of great practical benefit to modify PR8 and/or wt virus gene sequences for improved growth of vaccine 'seed' viruses."

In this study, we examined the genetic diversity of APMV-1 isolated from migratory birds sampled in Alaska, Japan, and Russia and assessed the evidence for intercontinental virus spread using phylogenetic methods. Additionally, we predicted viral virulence using deduced amino acid residues for the fusion protein cleavage site and estimated mutation rates for the fusion gene of class I and class II migratory bird isolates. All 73 isolates sequenced as part of this study were most closely related to virus genotypes previously reported for wild birds; however, five class II genotype I isolates formed a monophyletic clade exhibiting previously unreported genetic diversity, which met criteria for the designation of a new sub-genotype. Phylogenetic analysis of wild-bird isolates provided evidence for intercontinental virus spread, specifically viral lineages of APMV-1 class II genotype I sub-genotypes Ib and Ic. This result supports migratory bird movement as a possible mechanism for the redistribution of APMV-1. None of the predicted deduced amino acid motifs for the fusion protein cleavage site of APMV-1 strains isolated from migratory birds in Alaska, Japan, and Russia were consistent with those of previously identified virulent viruses. These data therefore provide no support for these strains contributing to the emergence of avian pathogens. The estimated mutation rates for fusion genes of class I and class II wild-bird isolates were faster than those reported previously for non-virulent APMV-1 strains. Collectively, these findings provide new insight into the diversity, spread, and evolution of APMV-1 in wild birds."

However, little is known about the intestinal community of viruses that is present in wild waterfowl, and the structure of this community in wild ducks has not yet been studied. The fecal virome compositions of six species of wild dabbling ducks and one species of wild diving duck were thus analyzed. Fecal samples were collected directly from the rectums of 60 ducks donated by hunters. DNA and RNA virus particles were purified and sequenced using the MiSeq Illumina platform. The reads obtained from the sequencing were analyzed and compared with sequences in the GenBank database. Viral-related sequences from the Herpesviridae, Alloherpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Retroviridae and Myoviridae viral families showed the highest overall abundances in the samples. The virome analysis identified viruses that had not been found in wild duck feces and revealed distinct virome profiles between different species and between samples of the same species. This study increases our understanding of viruses in wild ducks as possible viral reservoirs and provides a basis for further studying and monitoring the transmission of viruses from wild animals to humans and disease outbreaks in domestic animals."

The main tools available until now have been vaccines, antibiotics and antiparasitic drugs. Although these have been very successful in some cases, the appearance of parasite and microbial resistance to these treatments is a cause of concern. Next-generation sequencing provides important opportunities to tackle problems associated with pathogenic illnesses. This review describes the rapid gains achieved to track disease progression, identify the pathogens involved, and map pathogen interactions with the host. Use of novel genomic tools subsequently aids in treatment development, as well as successful creation of breeding programs aimed toward less susceptible livestock. These may be important tools for mitigating the long term effects of combating infection and helping reduce the reliance on antibiotic treatment."

Ticks rely on bacterial endosymbionts, which often share close and complex evolutionary links with tick-borne pathogens. As the prevalence, diversity and virulence potential of tick-borne agents remain poorly understood, there is a pressing need for microbial surveillance of ticks as potential disease vectors. We developed a two-stage protocol that includes 16S-amplicon screening of pooled samples of hard ticks collected from dogs, sheep and camels in Palestine, followed by shotgun metagenomics on individual ticks to detect and characterise tick-borne pathogens and endosymbionts. Two ticks isolated from sheep yielded an abundance of reads from the genus Rickettsia, which were assembled into draft genomes. One of the resulting genomes was highly similar to Rickettsia massiliae strain MTU5. Analysis of signature genes showed that the other represents the first genome sequence of the potential pathogen Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae. Ticks from a dog and a sheep yielded draft genome sequences of Coxiella strains. A sheep tick yielded sequences from the sheep pathogen Anaplasma ovis, while Hyalomma ticks from camels yielded sequences belonging to Francisella-like endosymbionts. From the metagenome of a dog tick from Jericho, we generated a genome sequence of a canine parvovirus. Here, we have shown how a cost-effective two-stage protocol can be used to detect and characterise tick-borne pathogens and endosymbionts. In recovering genome sequences from an unexpected pathogen (canine parvovirus) and a previously unsequenced pathogen (Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae), we demonstrate the open-ended nature of metagenomics. We also provide evidence that ticks can carry canine parvovirus, raising the possibility that ticks might contribute to the spread of this troublesome virus."

Networks are useful for representing a wide range of complex interactions ranging from those between molecular biomarkers, neurons, and microbial communities, to those found in human or animal populations. Recent technological advances have resulted in an increasing amount of healthcare data in multiple modalities, increasing the preponderance of network inference problems. Multi-domain data can now be used to improve the robustness and reliability of recovered networks from unimodal data. For infectious diseases in particular, there is a body of knowledge that has been focused on combining multiple pieces of linked information. Combining or analyzing disparate modalities in concert has demonstrated greater insight into disease transmission than could be obtained from any single modality in isolation. This has been particularly helpful in understanding incidence and transmission at early stages of infections that have pandemic potential. Novel pieces of linked information in the form of spatial, temporal, and other covariates including high-throughput sequence data, clinical visits, social network information, pharmaceutical prescriptions, and clinical symptoms (reported as free-text data) also encourage further investigation of these methods. The purpose of this review is to provide an in-depth analysis of multimodal infectious disease transmission network inference methods with a specific focus on Bayesian inference. We focus on analytical Bayesian inference-based methods as this enables recovering multiple parameters simultaneously, for example, not just the disease transmission network, but also parameters of epidemic dynamics. Our review studies their assumptions, key inference parameters and limitations, and ultimately provides insights about improving future network inference methods in multiple applications."

Hydrothermal vent systems are oases of biological activity in the deep oceans, for which knowledge of biodiversity and its impact on global ocean biogeochemical cycling is still in its infancy. In order to gain biological insight into viral communities present in hydrothermal vent systems, we developed a method based on deep-sequencing of pulsed field gel electrophoretic bands representing key viral fractions present in seawater within and surrounding a hydrothermal plume derived from Loki's Castle vent field at the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge. The reduction in virus community complexity afforded by this novel approach enabled the near-complete reconstruction of a lambda-like phage genome from the virus fraction of the plume. Phylogenetic examination of distinct gene regions in this lambdoid phage genome unveiled diversity at loci encoding superinfection exclusion- and integrase-like proteins. This suggests the importance of fine-tuning lyosgenic conversion as a viral survival strategy, and provides insights into the nature of host-virus and virus-virus interactions, within hydrothermal plumes. By reducing the complexity of the viral community through targeted sequencing of prominent dsDNA viral fractions, this method has selectively mimicked virus dominance approaching that hitherto achieved only through culturing, thus enabling bioinformatic analysis to locate a lambdoid viral ""needle"" within the greater viral community ""haystack"". Such targeted analyses have great potential for accelerating the extraction of biological knowledge from diverse and poorly understood environmental viral communities."

The study revealed that five of 70 (7.14%) faecal samples were found positive for PSV using RT-PCR. Three viruses were successfully isolated from faecal samples using IB-RS-2 cell line. Complete genome sequencing and analysis of one Indian PSV isolate revealed highest homology (88%) with V13 strain from England. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete polyprotein nucleotide sequences of 14 strains of PSV classified the viruses into four distinct clades. This first report from India adds to our knowledge on genetic diversity of PSV detected so far among pigs in different countries. A large-scale surveillance of the virus is required to understand its genomic diversity and economic impact."

However, knowledge of metagenomic responses to such conditions is still rudimentary. We analyzed the metagenomes of buffalo rumen in the liquid and solid phase of the rumen biomaterial from river buffalo adapted to varying proportion of concentrate to green or dry roughages, using high-throughput sequencing to know the occurrence of antibiotics resistance genes, genetic exchange between bacterial population and environmental reservoirs. A total of 3914.94 MB data were generated from all three treatments group. The data were analysed with Metagenome rapid annotation system tools. At phyla level, Bacteroidetes were dominant in all the treatments followed by Firmicutes. Genes coding for functional responses to stress (oxidative stress and heat shock proteins) and resistome genes (resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, phages, transposable elements and pathogenicity islands) were prevalent in similar proportion in liquid and solid fraction of rumen metagenomes. The fluoroquinolone resistance, MDR efflux pumps and Methicillin resistance genes were broadly distributed across 11, 9, and 14 bacterial classes, respectively. Bacteria responsible for phages replication and prophages and phage packaging and rlt-like streptococcal phage genes were mostly assigned to phyla Bacteroides, Firmicutes and proteaobacteria. Also, more reads matching the sigma B genes were identified in the buffalo rumen. This study underscores the presence of diverse mechanisms of adaptation to different diet, antibiotics and other stresses in buffalo rumen, reflecting the proportional representation of major bacterial groups."

Despite intensive vaccination, B1648 and its variants are still circulating in Europe and North Africa. Here, the full-length genome of this Belgian NIBV reference strain was determined by next generation sequencing (NGS) to understand its evolutionary relationship with other IBV strains, and to identify possible genetic factors that may be associated with the nephropathogenicity. Thirteen open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted in the B1648 strain (51UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-31UTR). ORFs 4b, 4c and 6b, which have been rarely reported in literature, were present in B1648 and most of the other IBV complete genomes. According to phylogenetic analysis of the full-length genome, replicase transcriptase complex, spike protein, partial S1 gene and M protein, B1648 strain clustered with the non-Massachusetts type strains NGA/A116E7/2006, UKr 27-11, QX-like ITA/90254/2005, QX-like CK/SWE/0658946/10, TN20/00, RF-27/99, RF/06/2007 and SLO/266/05. Based on the partial S1 fragment, B1648 clustered with the strains TN20/00, RF-27/99, RF/06/2007 and SLO/266/05 and, further designated as B1648 genotype. The full-length genome of B1648 shared the highest sequence homology with UKr 27-11, Gray, JMK, and NGA/A116E7/2006 (91.2% to 91.6%) and was least related with the reference Beaudette and Massachusetts strains (89.7%). Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses indicated that B1648 strain may have played an important role in the evolution of IBV in Europe and North Africa. Further, the nephropathogenicity determinants might be located on the 1a, spike, M and accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 4b, 4c, 5a, 5b and 6b). Overall, strain B1648 is distinct from all the strains reported so far in Europe and other parts of the world.</jats:p>"

However, these characteristics are defined by a complex interplay of viral and host factors so that phylogenetic measures of viral similarity are often poorly correlated to antigenic relationships. Here, we generate antigenic phylogenies that track the phenotypic evolution of two serotypes of foot-and-mouth disease virus by combining host serology and viral sequence data to identify sites that are critical to their antigenic evolution. For serotype SAT1, we validate our antigenic phylogeny against monoclonal antibody escape mutants, which match all of the predicted antigenic sites. For serotype O, we validate it against known sites where available, and otherwise directly evaluate the impact on antigenic phenotype of substitutions in predicted sites using reverse genetics and serology. We also highlight a critical and poorly understood problem for vaccine selection by revealing qualitative differences between assays that are often used interchangeably to determine antigenic match between field viruses and vaccine strains. Our approach provides a tool to identify naturally occurring antigenic substitutions, allowing us to track the genetic diversification and associated antigenic evolution of the virus. Despite the hugely important role vaccines have played in enhancing human and animal health, vaccinology remains a conspicuously empirical science. This study advances the field by providing guidance for tuning vaccine strains via site-directed mutagenesis through this high-resolution tracking of antigenic evolution of the virus between rare major shifts in phenotype."

The causative agent, beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), was recently detected in the largest remaining population of endangered Cape parrots (Poicepahlus robustus), which are endemic to South Africa. Full-length genomes were isolated and sequenced from 26 blood samples collected from wild and captive Cape parrots to determine possible origins of infection. All sequences had characteristic BFDV sequence motifs and were similar in length to those described in the literature. However, BFDV coat protein (CP) sequences from this study did not contain a previously identified bipartite nuclear localisation signal (NLS) within residues 39-56, which indicates that an alternate NLS is involved in shuttling the CP into the nucleus. Sequences from the wild population shared a high degree of similarity, irrespective of year or location, suggesting that the disease outbreak occurred close to the time when the samples were collected. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomes showed that the captive Cape parrot sequences cluster with those isolated from captive-bred budgerigars in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. Exposure to captive-bred Cape parrots from a breeding facility in KwaZulu-Natal is suggested as a possible source for the virus infection. Phylogenetic analysis of BFDV isolates from wild and captive Cape parrots indicated two separate infection events in different populations, which highlights the potential risk of introducing new strains of the virus into the wild population. The present study represents the first systematic investigation of BFDV virus diversity in the southern-most population of Cape parrots."

Using a high-throughput strategy to isolate new giant viruses from their original protozoan hosts, we obtained eight isolates of a new giant viral lineage from Vermamoeba vermiformis, the most common free-living protist found in human environments. This new lineage was proposed to be the faustovirus lineage. The prototype member, faustovirus E12, forms icosahedral virions of â 200 nm that are devoid of fibrils and that encapsidate a 466-kbp genome encoding 451 predicted proteins.

About two-thirds of these genes do not show significant similarity to genes encoding any known proteins. These findings show that expanding the panel of protists to discover new giant viruses is a fruitful strategy. By using Vermamoeba, a protist living in humans and their environment, we isolated eight strains of a new giant virus that we named faustovirus.

Within this family, HCV is closely related to viruses of the genus Pestivirus, which includes classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Translation of the hepaci- and pestiviral polyprotein is initiated by internal entry of ribosomes, promoted by the 5'NTR. The secondary and tertiary RNA structures of the HCV and pestivirus 5'NTRs are well conserved, despite the fact that their sequences differ significantly from one another. By analogy with other positive-stranded RNA viruses, the 5'NTR of HCV is likely to contain cis-acting determinants for replication as well as the determinants for translation. Studies on both signals could be complicated, as these signals might overlap. In this study, this problem was addressed by constructing chimeric HCV/CSFV 5'NTRs. A two-step analysis of these 5'NTRs was performed: (a) in a translation assay, which provided the possibility to study translation independently of the possible effects on replication; and (b) in a replication assay, in which were studied only the chimeric 5'NTRs for which IRES-dependent translation was demonstrated. An overlap was observed between HCV RNA elements involved in these processes. Exchange of domain II had a minor effect on the translation efficiency of the chimeric 5'NTRs, while replication of subgenomic replicons with these chimeric 5'NTRs was abolished. Exchange of domain III subdomains severely decreased translation activity, while replication was maintained."

          <jats:p>The strain diversity of a rubulavirus, parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), was investigated by comparing 11 newly determined and 6 previously published genome sequences. These sequences represent 15 PIV5 strains, of which 6 were isolated from humans, 1 was from monkeys, 2 were from pigs, and 6 were from dogs. Strain diversity is remarkably low, regardless of host, year of isolation, or geographical origin; a total of 7.8% of nucleotides are variable, and the average pairwise difference between strains is 2.1%. Variation is distributed unevenly across the PIV5 genome, but no convincing evidence of selection for antibody-mediated evasion in hemagglutinin-neuraminidase was found. The finding that some canine and porcine, but not primate, strains are mutated in the SH gene, and do not produce SH, raised the possibility that dogs (or pigs) may not be the natural host of PIV5. The genetic stability of PIV5 was also demonstrated during serial passage of one strain (W3) in Vero cells at a high multiplicity of infection, under conditions of competition with large proportions of defective interfering genomes. A similar observation was made for a strain W3 mutant (PIV5VÎC) lacking V gene function, in which the dominant changes were related to pseudoreversion in this gene. The mutations detected in PIV5VÎC during pseudoreversion, and also those characterizing the SH gene in canine and porcine strains, predominantly involved U-to-C transitions. This suggests an important role for biased hypermutation via an adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific (ADAR)-like activity.</jats:p>

            Here we report the sequence variation of 16 different isolates of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) that were isolated from a number of species, including humans, monkeys, dogs, and pigs, over 4 decades. Surprisingly, strain diversity was remarkably low, regardless of host, year of isolation, or geographical origin. Variation was distributed unevenly across the PIV5 genome, but no convincing evidence of immune or host selection was found. This overall genome stability of PIV5 was also observed when the virus was grown in the laboratory, and the genome stayed remarkably constant even during the selection of virus mutants. Some of the canine isolates had lost their ability to encode one of the viral proteins, termed SH, suggesting that although PIV5 commonly infects dogs, dogs may not be the natural host for PIV5.

We suggest that the virus be named New Minto for the location in which the ticks were collected. Prototype New Minto virus is sensitive to the action of sodium deoxycholate and kills suckling mice by the intracerebral but not intraperitoneal route; weaned mice do not die after intracerebral, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous inoculation. The virus produces plaque in serially propagated Vero but not in primary Pekin duck embryo cells.By complement-fixation and neutralization tests New Minto is related to Sawgrass virus, a hitherto ungrouped virus from Florida. The establishment of a Sawgrass group is suggested. In addition, Sawgrass virus was found by electron microscopy to belong to the Family Rhabdoviridae. </jats:p>"

These viruses are classified according to the antigenic properties of the two glycoproteins, expressed on the surface of the virus particles, the hemagglutinin (HA or H) and the neuraminidase (NA or N). To date, 17 H and 10âN have been described and 116 HxNy combinations or subtypes reported. Except for the H17N10 subtype recently identified in bats, all identified subtypes have been identified in wild aquatic birds. These birds are considered to be the natural reservoir of influenza A viruses, from which some subtypes can be transmitted to other bird and mammal species, including humans. Interspecies transmissions seem to occur regularly, and can occasionally lead to the adaptation and stable establishment of a new viral lineage in a given species. This review recalls the genetic diversity of avian, swine and human influenza viruses and focuses on lesser-known influenza A viruses, identified in horses, dogs and very recently in bats. It discusses the genetic mixing that may result from interspecies transmission, and the associated risks of epizootics, zoonosis and pandemics."

The RNA probe was derived from the coding region at the 3â² end of the genome of the NADL strain of BVDV. Total RNA from infected cell cultures or peripheral blood leukocytes from suspect animals was extracted and applied to nylon membranes with a slot blot apparatus. Peripheral blood leukocytes were tested concurrently for BVDV by virus isolation. The results of hybridization and virus isolation were in agreement for 92% of the cases. When compared with virus isolation, hybridization had a sensitivity of detection of 59.5% and a specificity of 95%. Cross-reactivity to RNA extracts of border disease virus-infected cells was noted. No cross-reactivity was detected to other common bovine viruses (bovine herpesvirus-l, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza-3 virus, and bluetongue virus), to viruses classified in related families (equine arteritis virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus), or to viruses having similar genomic organization (dengue virus type 2 and Japanese encephalitis virus). </jats:p>"

In this review, we examine the applications of new high-throughput sequencing approaches to the identification and characterization of outbreaks, focusing on the application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to outbreaks of bacterial infection. We describe traditional epidemiological analysis and show how WGS can be informative at multiple steps in outbreak investigation, as evidenced by many recent studies. We conclude that high-throughput sequencing approaches can make a significant contribution to the investigation of outbreaks of bacterial infection and that the integration of WGS with epidemiological investigation, diagnostic assays and antimicrobial susceptibility testing will precipitate radical changes in clinical microbiology and infectious disease epidemiology in the near future. However, several challenges remain before WGS can be routinely used in outbreak investigation and clinical practice."

These different studies gave unique names to the identified groups and no study has yet integrated all the available sequences. Thus, we hypothesized that many of the different groups previously identified actually correspond to a limited group of genotypes that are unevenly distributed worldwide. To examine this hypothesis, we sequenced the env gene from 28 BLV field strains and compared these sequences to 46 env sequences that represent all the genetic groupings already identified. By using phylogenetic analyses, we recovered six clades, or genotypes, that we have called genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Genotypes 1-5 have counterparts among the sequence groupings identified previously. One env sequence did not cluster with any of the others and was highly divergent when compared with the six genotypes identified here. Thus, an extra genotype, which we named 7, may exist. Similarity comparisons were highly congruent with phylogenetic analyses. Furthermore, our analyses confirmed the existence of geographical clusters."

Samples of lymph nodes were taken from 4 PMWS-affected pigs and 2 healthy animals and processed by transmission electron microscopy. Significant ultrastructural alterations were only noted in PMWS-affected pigs, mainly in histiocytes and rarely in other cell types. Histiocytes showed severe swelling and proliferation of mitochondria, and proliferation and dilation of rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. Infected histiocytes contained large numbers of intracytoplasmic inclusion (ICI) bodies with VLPs; some histiocytes also had intranuclear inclusions (INIs). Small inclusions were surrounded by double membrane, with a granular appearance or containing paracrystalline arrays; icosahedral VLPs were 8â17 nm in diameter. Large ICIs were double-membrane bounded or not and contained VLPs usually forming paracrystalline arrays. ICIs were often found next to mitochondria with severe swelling, and also inside them. INIs were not surrounded by membranes and contained virions of 10â13 nm diameter. Lymphocyte depletion was a striking finding of lymph nodes from PMWS-affected pigs. The inclusion bodies containing VLPs referred to in the present study should be classified as viral factories, suggesting that viral replication is probably a frequent event in macrophages, in which mitochondria might play a role. </jats:p>"

Circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N1 is continuously causing significant economic losses to the Egyptian poultry industry and is a threat to public health. In this report, a HPAI H5N1 strain (A/chicken/Egypt/Fadllah-7/2014) was detected from a vaccinated flock showing clinical signs of infection. Genetic characterization of the isolate indicated a high level of nucleotide identity (95-98%) with variant and classical groups of H5N1. Moreover, multiple-nucleotide and amino acid alignments revealed several prominent and characteristic substitutions in the surface glycoprotein, which may have biological relevance to the pathobiology of the virus. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the reported isolate closely relates to H5N1 AIVs subclade 2.2.1.1 in spite of no reports of this subclade since 2011 from AI reported cases in Egyptian avian species. In conclusion, our results highlight the re-emergence of a novel H5N1 AIV variant subclade 2.2.1.1 that could escape immunity induced by vaccines.

The question we wished to address in this study is whether these highly pathogenic strains constitute unique lineages or whether they and related nonpathogenic viruses are derived from common ancestors in the wild bird reservoir. We therefore compared the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the hemagglutinin (HA) genes of 15 H5 and 26 H7 influenza A viruses isolated over 91 years from a variety of host species in Eurasia, Africa, Australia, and North America. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the HA genes of H5 and H7 viruses that cause severe disease in domestic birds do not form unique lineages but share common ancestors with nonpathogenic H5 and H7 viruses. These findings predict that highly pathogenic avian H5 and H7 influenza A viruses will continue to emerge from wild bird reservoirs. Another important question is whether H7 influenza viruses found in mammalian species are derived from avian strains. We included eight equine influenza viruses and one seal isolate in the phylogenetic analysis of H7 HA genes. We could show that the HA genes of both, the equine and the seal viruses, shared ancestors with avian H7 HA genes. This indicates that currently circulating H7 viruses with an avian HA gene may have the potential to adapt to mammalian species and to cause an influenza outbreak in the new host."

A high abundance of viral genotypes (785) were present within the virome. The absolute numbers of lambdoid and Shiga toxin (Stx) encoding phages detected suggested that the depth of sequencing had enabled recovery of only ca. 8% of the total virus population, numbers that agreed within less than an order of magnitude with predictions made by rarefaction analysis. The most abundant viral genotypes in the pond were bacteriophages (93.7%). The predominant viral genotypes infecting higher life forms found in association with the farm were pathogens that cause disease in cattle and humans, e.g. members of the Herpesviridae.

The phylogenetic data showed a close relationship of all the studied viruses with suid herpesvirus 1. On the basis of sequence data for the gB gene, a nested PCR combined with restriction enzyme analysis (REA) of the PCR products was developed for the simultaneous detection and identification of the viruses that were studied. Nested primers from highly conserved sequence stretches were selected in order to amplify a region of 294 bp in all five viruses, and a subsequent REA of the PCR products allowed specific identification. A mimic molecule that served as an internal standard of the amplification efficiency was constructed.

Members of this family are known to cause fatal diseases in birds and pigs and have been historically classified in one of two genera: Circovirus, which contains avian and porcine pathogens, and Gyrovirus, which includes a single species (Chicken anemia virus). However, over the course of the past six years, viral metagenomic approaches as well as degenerate PCR detection in unconventional hosts and environmental samples have elucidated a broader host range, including fish, a diversity of mammals, and invertebrates, for members of the family Circoviridae. Notably, these methods have uncovered a distinct group of viruses that are closely related to members of the genus Circovirus and comprise a new genus, Cyclovirus. The discovery of new viruses and a re-evaluation of genomic features that characterize members of the Circoviridae prompted a revision of the classification criteria used for this family of animal viruses. Here we provide details on an updated Circoviridae taxonomy ratified by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses in 2016, which establishes the genus Cyclovirus and reassigns the genus Gyrovirus to the family Anelloviridae, a separate lineage of animal viruses that also contains circular ssDNA genomes. In addition, we provide a new species demarcation threshold of 80% genome-wide pairwise identity for members of the family Circoviridae, based on pairwise identity distribution analysis, and list guidelines to distinguish between members of this family and other eukaryotic viruses with circular, ssDNA genomes."

Although whiteflies are known to transmit both DNA and RNA viruses, most of the diversity has been recorded for the former, specifically for the Begomovirus genus. This study investigated the total diversity of DNA and RNA viruses found in whiteflies collected from a single site in Florida to evaluate if there are additional, previously undetected viral types within the B. tabaci vector. Metagenomic analysis of viral DNA extracted from the whiteflies only resulted in the detection of begomoviruses. In contrast, whiteflies contained sequences similar to RNA viruses from divergent groups, with a diversity that extends beyond currently described viruses. The metagenomic analysis of whiteflies also led to the first report of a whitefly-transmitted RNA virus similar to Cowpea mild mottle virus (CpMMV Florida) (genus Carlavirus) in North America. Further investigation resulted in the detection of CpMMV Florida in native and cultivated plants growing near the original field site of whitefly collection and determination of its experimental host range. Analysis of complete CpMMV Florida genomes recovered from whiteflies and plants suggests that the current classification criteria for carlaviruses need to be reevaluated. Overall, metagenomic analysis supports that DNA plant viruses carried by B. tabaci are dominated by begomoviruses, whereas significantly less is known about RNA viruses present in this damaging insect vector."

The datasets were then analysed using a bioinformatic pipeline developed around recent fast classification methods. A targeted approach was able to detect 20 of the viruses against a background of host contamination from multiple sources and bacterial contamination. An alternative untargeted identification method was highly correlated with these classifications, and over 1,600 species were identified when applied to the complex biological model, including several species captured at over 50% genome coverage.

They are subject to strong purifying selection and associate with Argonautes, consistent with a critical function in silencing of important cellular and/or viral targets. Bovine leukemia virus microRNAs are strongly expressed in preleukemic and malignant cells in which structural and regulatory gene expression is repressed, suggesting a key role in tumor onset and progression. Understanding how Pol III-dependent microRNAs subvert cellular and viral pathways will contribute to deciphering the intricate perturbations that underlie malignant transformation."

Fourteen putative viral sequence fragments over 30 Kbp in length were assembled and annotated. Many of the putative genes in the assembled contigs showed no homology to previously annotated genes, highlighting the large amount of work still required to fully annotate the functions encoded in viral genomes. The abundance of the contig sequences varied widely between animals, even though the cattle were of the same age, stage of lactation and fed the same diets. Additionally the twelve animals which were co-habited shared a number of their dominant viral contigs. We compared the functional characteristics of our bovine viromes with that of other viromes, as well as rumen microbiomes. At the functional level, we found strong similarities between all of the viral samples, which were highly distinct from the rumen microbiome samples.

Thorough follow-up using specific real-time RT-PCR assays targeting the detected sequence fragments confirmed the presence of these sequences in the original sample as well as in a sample of an additional animal, but a contamination with an identical genetic signature in negative extraction controls was demonstrated. Further investigation using an alternative extraction method identified a contamination of the originally used Qiagen extraction columns with parvovirus-like nucleic acids or virus particles. Although we did not find any relevant virus that could be associated with the disease, these observations clearly illustrate the importance of using a proper control strategy and follow-up diagnostic tests in any viral metagenomic study."

During the clinical phase, severe vesicular lesions on snout and skin around the coronary bands were observed in pigs. A total of 48 serum samples and 12 clinical samples (ruptured snout epithelia) were collected. All serum samples were subjected to indirect 3AB nonstructural protein (NSP) ELISA and liquid phase blocking (LPB) ELISA. In 3AB NSP ELISA, all serum samples were found positive for NSP antibodies indicating infection. In LPB ELISA, 42 of 48 (87.5%) pigs were found to have protective log10 antibody titre of Â³1.8 against FMD virus serotypes O, A and Asia 1. All the clinical materials were found positive for serotype O in antigen detection ELISA as well as in multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR). In VP1 region-based phylogenetic analysis, the serotype O isolates causing the outbreak were found to conglomerate within Ind2001 lineage. Pigs infected with FMD may pose rigorous threat to other susceptible domestic livestock as they exhale enormous quantity of virus. As a consequence, they should be included under prophylactic vaccination and surveillance programmes ongoing in the country.</jats:p>"

Velogenic viruses carry the motif (112)R-R-Q-K-R/F(117) (n=14) or (112)G-R-Q-G-R/L(117) (n=3) at the F0 cleavage site, while all the lentogenic virus had a sequence motif of (112)G-R-Q-G-R/L(117) (n=3) at the same site. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that at least three distinct genotypes (genotypes I, II and VII) existed in chicken flocks in China and VIId of genotype VII were mainly responsible for the present ND panzootic. Two natural recombinants (XD/Shandong/08 and QG/Hebei/07) were supposed and identified by the SimPlot program, and their two parental-like strains might be from the NDV vaccine lineage and VIId velogenic lineage respectively. The results indicate that recombination play a role in NDV evolution and the live vaccines have capacity to boost NDV evolution by homologous recombination with circulating virus."

Although the majority of confirmed rabies cases in wild carnivore species are reported from the yellow mongoose (Cynictis penicillata), the rest are from other wild carnivores including the highly endangered wild dog (Lycaon pictus). Lyssavirus infection was confirmed in two wild dogs and a spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) in the Madikwe Game Reserve, North West province in South Africa, in 2014 and 2015, using a direct fluorescent antibody test and immunohistochemistry. There had been no new wild dog introductions to the Madikwe Game Reserve for many years and the wild dogs were last vaccinated against rabies approximately 11 years prior to the incident. The first euthanised wild dog was the last surviving of a break-away pack of 6, and the second was the last of a larger pack of 18, the rest of which died with no carcasses being found or carcasses too decomposed for sampling. Subsequent antigenic typing of the lyssaviruses indicated that they were canid RABVs. The RABVs originating from 22 wild carnivore species, 7 dogs, and a caprine, mostly from the North West province, were genetically characterised by targeting a partial region of the nucleoprotein gene. The nucleotide sequence analyses of these viruses and two previously characterised RABVs confirmed that the outbreak viruses were also canid rabies, phylogenetically clustering with virus isolates originating from black-backed jackals recovered between 2012 and 2015 from the North West province, and domestic dogs from neighbouring communal areas. The source(s) of the mortalities and possible reservoir host(s) for the virus could only be speculated upon from data on specific predator numbers, movements and behaviour, kills, park management and the changing environmental ecology, which were monitored closely in Madikwe over several years. The most likely rabies sources were from boundary fence contacts between wild carnivores within the park, with domestic dogs or cats and/or naturally occurring wild carnivores outside the park. The associated risk of zoonotic infection and threat to important and endangered predators may be mitigated through regional rabies control primarily in domestic dogs and cats, as well as by preventative vaccination of at-risk park employees and their pets. The importance of ongoing prophylactic rabies protection by regular vaccination of highly endangered wildlife carnivores and the submission of carcasses for rabies diagnosis of any wild or domestic animals behaving uncharacteristically or found dead is emphasised."

Despite extensive vaccination efforts within the poultry industry, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) outbreaks causing significant economic losses still occur. Rural chickens may act as a potential reservoir of NDVs for commercial poultry due to poor biosecurity and inadequate vaccination. The aim of this study was to investigate the phylogenetic relationship and molecular characterization of eight NDVs isolated from backyard poultry in Iran during 2011-2013. The complete coding sequence of fusion (F) and haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) genes of eight NDVs were determined and compared with other published NDVs. Based on inter-population distances and phylogenetic topology between available NDV categories, Iranian isolates formed a novel VIIl sub-genotype distinct from previous groups designated in genotype VII. Furthermore, both F and HN genes of the Iranian isolates shared high nucleotide sequence similarity with viruses isolated in China. All viruses analysed contained a polybasic cleavage site motif ("

Only little is known about factors influencing its general composition. Here, the effect of the probiotic bacterium Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) NCIMB 10415 on the pig faecal virome composition was analysed in a pig feeding trial with sows and their piglets, which received either the probiotic bacterium or not. From 8 pooled faecal samples derived from the feeding trial, DNA and RNA virus particles were prepared and subjected to process-controlled Next Generation Sequencing resulting in 390,650 sequence reads. In average, 14% of the reads showed significant sequence identities to known viruses. The percentage of detected mammalian virus sequences was highest (55-77%) in the samples of the youngest piglets and lowest (8-10%) in the samples of the sows. In contrast, the percentage of bacteriophage sequences increased from 22-44% in the youngest piglets to approximately 90% in the sows. The dominating mammalian viruses differed remarkably among 12 day-old piglets (kobuvirus), 54 day-old piglets (boca-, dependo- and pig stool-associated small circular DNA virus [PigSCV]) and the sows (PigSCV, circovirus and ""circovirus-like"" viruses CB-A and RW-A). In addition, the Shannon index, which reflects the diversity of sequences present in a sample, was generally higher for the sows as compared to the piglets. No consistent differences in the virome composition could be identified between the viromes of the probiotic bacterium-treated group and the control group. The analysis indicates that the pig faecal virome shows a high variability and that its general composition is mainly dependent on the age of the pigs. Changes caused by feeding with the probiotic bacterium E. faecium could not be demonstrated using the applied metagenomics method."

In contrast to usual-type VIN (uVIN), which is related to infection by human papillomavirus (HPV), a germline mutation in the p53 gene is thought to be associated with ~90% of dVIN cases. To date, no infectious agent has been identified in association with dVIN, and studies investigating this possibility have been hindered by the difficulty in accurately diagnosing dVIN from small biopsies. Here, we used immunostaining for p16ink4a), a biomarker for HPV infection, to study 14 uVIN high-grade VIN and 14 dVIN cases, and to select 10 dVIN cases to broadly screen for all kn(own viruses using a pan-viral microarray platform (ViroChip). All of the uVIN tissue samples, including 8 warty and 6 basaloid cases, showed positivity with the p16(ink4a) immunostain. The staining pattern was full-thickness for all except two cases in which positive staining was localized in the lower 1/3 of the epidermis. In contrast, immunostaining for p16(ink4a) was negative in all dVIN cases. ViroChip analysis of 10 pure dVIN samples confirmed the absence of human papillomavirus subtypes or any other virus with the exception of a single sample that showed a weak microarray signature to a porcine herpesvirus. Follow-up PCR testing of the sample was negative for herpesvirus, and in-depth metagenomic next-generation sequencing revealed only sequences corresponding to non-pathogenic viral flora and bacterial contamination. In this study, we demonstrated lack of a virus association in 10 dVIN cases. Alternative pathways for carcinogenesis such as the p53 mutation should be considered for investigation of potential treatment options in dVIN."

To date, no studies have been performed to antigenically subtype PCV2 strains enclosing eight PCV2 clusters. The present study aimed to antigenically subtype PCV2 and perform epitopes' competition analysis using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Fourteen PCV2 strains representative for eight clusters were tested with 20 mAbs (fifteen of them were generated against PCV2a strain Stoon-1010 and 5 of them against PCV2b strain 1147) in immunoperoxidase monolayer assays. Four mAbs reacted to all 14 PCV2 strains and one mAb reacted with all strains except for a PCV2a-2C strain. One mAb reacted with all PCV2a strains, except for a PCV2a-2C strain and one mAb reacted with all PCV2b strains, except for a PCV2b-1C strain. Nine mAbs reacted with the strains of PCV2b-1A/1B, PCV2a-2A and PCV2a-2E. Three mAbs only reacted with the strains of PCV2a-2A and PCV2a-2E. One mAb reacted specifically with the strains of PCV2b-1A/1B. This suggests that discrete antigenic differences exist between different PCV2 genetic clusters and that these clusters can be discriminated by the use of a panel of universal and cluster-specific mAbs. Six mAbs were selected for cross-competition analysis by a competitive ELISA using PCV2 strain Stoon-1010. Six overlapping epitopes were identified on the PCV2 capsid protein. The universal mAbs recognized larger epitopes than the cluster-specific mAbs. These findings are helpful in the development of diagnostic tests and new generation vaccines against PCV2."

Phylogenetic and antigenic analyses demonstrated the diversity among H9 HA. A/Hong Kong/1073/99 was shown to cause a respiratory infection in Syrian hamsters, suggesting that the virus can replicate efficiently in mammalian hosts. We developed a whole virion test vaccine with a formalin-inactivated egg-grown HK1073. Intraperitoneal administration of the vaccine twice to hamsters conferred a complete protection against challenge infection by the MDCK cell-grown homologous virus. Receptor specificity of HK1073 appeared different from that of other avian influenza viruses of H9 subtype which recognize preferentially alpha-2,3 linked sialic acid. Hemagglutination of HK1073 with guinea pig erythrocytes was inhibited by both alpha-2,3 and alpha-2,6 linked sialic acid containing polymers. These data suggested that HK1073 had acquired a broader host range, including humans. Together with data so far available, the present study suggested that isolation of the H9 influenza viruses from humans requires precaution against the emergence of a novel human influenza."

The clinical signs included watery discharge from eyes, apathy, loss of appetite, salivation, lameness and nodular skin lesions. Capripoxvirus genome was detected by real-time PCR in the tissue samples of sick animals. The aetiological agent was isolated in the primary cell cultures of lamb testis and goat testis, as well as in the continuous MDBK cell culture. Further sequencing of the GPCR gene and phylogenetic analysis showed the close genetic relationship of isolated capripoxvirus with a group of lumpy skin disease virus. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by the experimental infection of four calves with a suspension of tissue samples from sick animals."

The butyrophilin genes are members of the B7 family, playing diverse roles in co-regulation and perhaps in antigen presentation. In humans, a fixed number of butyrophilin genes are found in and around the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and show striking association with particular autoimmune diseases. In chickens, BG genes encode homologues with somewhat different domain organisation. Only a few BG genes have been characterised, one involved in actin-myosin interaction in the intestinal brush border, and another implicated in resistance to viral diseases. We characterise all BG genes in B12 chickens, finding a multigene family organised as tandem repeats in the BG region outside the MHC, a single gene in the MHC (the BF-BL region), and another single gene on a different chromosome. There is a precise cell and tissue expression for each gene, but overall there are two kinds, those expressed by haemopoietic cells and those expressed in tissues (presumably non-haemopoietic cells), correlating with two different kinds of promoters and 5' untranslated regions (5'UTR). However, the multigene family in the BG region contains many hybrid genes, suggesting recombination and/or deletion as major evolutionary forces. We identify BG genes in the chicken whole genome shotgun sequence, as well as by comparison to other haplotypes by fibre fluorescence in situ hybridisation, confirming dynamic expansion and contraction within the BG region. Thus, the BG genes in chickens are undergoing much more rapid evolution compared to their homologues in mammals, for reasons yet to be understood."

A sequence analysis of the full-length mRNA encoding the fusion glycoprotein precursor (F0) of the NDV's fusion proteins F1 and F2 in these six isolates showed the presence of point mutations in form of nucleic acid substitutions at positions 82((CâT)), 83((TâC)), 736((AâG)), and 1,633((GâA)). However, the nucleic acid residues at positions 330-347 of the precursor F0 gene, corresponding to the cleavage site of the F0 protein, were found to have remained conserved among the six NDV isolates. A phylogenetic comparison between the six Iranian isolates and the NDVs whose F0 gene sequences were previously deposited in GenBank Database showed that all of the newly characterized Iranian NDV isolates belonged to genotype VII."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships among lumpy skin disease viruses (LSDV) isolated from different regions of Iran and the origin and spread of these viruses. In this study, a total of 234 blood samples from clinically affected animals from four provinces in the northwest of Iran were screened for LSDV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). From 80 positive samples for LSDV detected by PCR, the partial P32 gene (759Â bp) of 12 isolates were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. LSD viruses were grouped in three subclusters with an overall 97.1-100% nucleotide identity. LSDVs isolated from Gilan showed lowest nucleotide identity with the other LSDVs. Four isolates of LSDV including KO-1, EA-1, EA-3, and WA-3 showed 100% similarity with each other and also with the Neethling strain. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the identified LSDVs were closely related to each other and had high-sequence homology with other LSDV isolates from Africa. It was concluded that LSD outbreak probably occurred in the northwest of Iran by LSDVs entering the country from Iraq and P32 nucleotide sequence information obtained in the present study is a valuable resource in understanding the genetic nature and molecular epidemiology of local LSDV isolates which can be used for future vaccine development based on the circulating strains in the region."

We hypothesized that a blood-based transcriptional signature could be discovered indicating a host systemic response to viral infection. Previous work identified host transcriptional signatures to individual viruses including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and dengue, but the generality of these signatures across all viral infection types has not been established. Based on 44 publicly available datasets and two clinical studies of our own design, we discovered and validated a four-gene expression signature in whole blood, indicative of a general host systemic response to many types of viral infection. The signature's genes are: Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15), Interleukin 16 (IL16), 2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase Like (OASL), and Adhesion G Protein Coupled Receptor E5 (ADGRE5). In each of 13 validation datasets encompassing human, macaque, chimpanzee, pig, mouse, rat and all seven Baltimore virus classification groups, the signature provides statistically significant (pâ<â0.05) discrimination between viral and non-viral conditions. The signature may have clinical utility for differentiating host systemic inflammation (SI) due to viral versus bacterial or non-infectious causes."

The genomes of representatives of all APMV serotypes except APMV type 5 have recently been fully sequenced. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of the APMV-5 prototype strain budgerigar/Kunitachi/74. APMV-5 Kunitachi virus is unusual in that it lacks a virion hemagglutinin and does not grow in the allantoic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs. However, the virus grew in the amniotic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs and in twelve different established cell lines and two primary cell cultures. The genome is 17,262 nucleotides (nt) long, which is the longest among members of genus Avulavirus, and encodes six non-overlapping genes in the order of 3'N-P/V/W-M-F-HN-L-5' with intergenic regions of 4-57 nt. The genome length follows the 'rule of six' and contains a 55-nt leader sequence at the 3'end and a 552 nt trailer sequence at the 5' end. The phosphoprotein (P) gene contains a conserved RNA editing site and is predicted to encode P, V, and W proteins. The cleavage site of the F protein (G-K-R-K-K-R downward arrowF) conforms to the cleavage site motif of the ubiquitous cellular protease furin. Consistent with this, exogenous protease was not required for virus replication in vitro. However, the intracerebral pathogenicity index of APMV-5 strain Kunitachi in one-day-old chicks was found to be zero, indicating that the virus is avirulent for chickens despite the presence of a polybasic F cleavage site. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences of the APVM-5 genome and proteins versus those of the other APMV serotypes showed that APMV-5 is more closely related to APMV-6 than to the other APMVs. Furthermore, these comparisons provided evidence of extensive genome-wide divergence that supports the classification of the APMVs into nine separate serotypes. The structure of the F cleavage site does not appear to be a reliable indicator of virulence among APMV serotypes 2-9. The availability of sequence information for all known APMV serotypes will facilitate studies in epidemiology and vaccinology."

Bluetongue virus (BTV) is classified among category ""A"" diseases notifiable to the World Organization of Animal Health (OIE), and is transmitted among ruminants by biting midges of the genus Culicoides. Here, we developed a comprehensive occurrence data set to map the current distribution, estimate the ecological niche, and explore the future potential distribution of BTV globally using ecological niche modeling and based on diverse future climate scenarios from general circulation models (GCMs) for four representative concentration pathways (RCPs). The broad ecological niche and potential geographic distribution of BTV under present-day conditions reflected the disease's current distribution across the world in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. All model predictions were significantly better than random expectations. As a further evaluation of model robustness, we compared our model predictions to 331 independent records from most recent outbreaks from the Food and Agriculture Organization Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases Information System (EMPRES-i); all were successfully anticipated by the BTV model. Finally, we tested ecological niche similarity among possible vectors and BTV, and could not reject hypotheses of niche similarity. Under future-climate conditions, the potential distribution of BTV was predicted to broaden, especially in central Africa, United States, and western Russia."

NA possesses sialidase activity, which is functionally important at multiple points in viral replication, counter-balancing the sialic acid receptor binding activity of the hemagglutinin (HA), the other major envelope glycoprotein. The NA proteins of influenza A viruses have been classified into nine serological subtypes, and they undergo antigenic drift variation similar to that of HA. Antibodies to NA are analyzed much less often than antibodies to HA. The conventional assay for NA inhibition (NI) antibody titration, established decades ago, is widely considered unwieldy and inefficient for routine use. In recent years, a few new formats have been developed which still measure inhibition of NA enzymatic function, but more efficiently and with less chemical waste produced. Described here is the enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA), which is performed in 96-well plates and analyzed on a spectrophotometric plate reader. An important factor in adoption of the ELLA technique for animal studies, such as swine, is the choice of NA antigen, which may be purified protein or whole virus containing an antigenically irrelevant HA protein. This NI assay, in conjunction with the hemagglutination inhibiting (HI) antibody assay, offers a practical way to characterize viral isolates more fully and to quantify antibodies induced by infection or vaccination."

Out of 58 scabs (35 sheep and 23 goats) screened, 27 sheep and 18 goat scabs were found positive for capripox virus infections. With the exception of one sheep and one goat scabs, all the positive samples yielded amplicon size according to host origin, i.e. SPPV in sheep and GTPV in goats. In the above two exceptional cases, goat scab and sheep scab yielded amplicon size as that of SPPV and GTPV, respectively. Further, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of complete ORFs of RPO30 and GPCR genes from six sheep and three goat scabs revealed that with the exception of above two samples, all had host-specific signatures and clustered according to their host origin. In case of cross-species infecting samples, sheep scab possessed GTPV-like signatures and goat scab possessed SPPV-like signatures.

SRLVs are endemic in many countries, including Canada. However, very little is known about the genetic characteristics of Canadian SRLVs, particularly in the province of Ontario. Given the importance of surveillance and eradication programs for the control of SRLVs, it is imperative that the diagnostic tests used to identify infected animals are sensitive to local strains of SRLVs. The aim of this work was to characterize SRLV strains circulating in Ontario and to evaluate the variability of the immunodominant regions of the Gag protein. In this study, the nearly complete gag sequence of 164 SRLVs, from 130 naturally infected sheep and 32 naturally infected goats from Ontario, was sequenced. Animals belonged to distantly located single and mixed species (sheep and goats) farms. Ovine lentiviruses from the same farm tended to cluster more closely together than did caprine lentiviruses from the same farm. Sequence analysis revealed a higher degree of heterogeneity among the caprine lentivirus sequences with an average inter-farm pairwise DNA distance of 10% and only 5% in the ovine lentivirus group. Interestingly, amplification of SRLVs from ELISA positive sheep was successful in 81% of cases, whereas amplification of SRLV proviral DNA was only possible in 55% of the ELISA positive goat samples; suggesting that a significant portion of caprine lentiviruses circulating in Ontario possess heterogeneity at the primer binding sites used in this study. Sequences of sheep and goat SRLVs from Ontario were assembled into phylogenetic trees with other known SRLVs and were found to belong to sequence groups A2 and B1, respectively, as defined by Shah et al. (2004a). A novel caprine lentivirus with a pairwise genetic difference of 15.6-25.4% relative to other group B subtypes was identified. Thus we suggest the designation of a novel subtype, B4, within the caprine lentivirus-like cluster. Lastly, we demonstrate evidence of recombination between ovine lentiviruses. These results emphasize the broad genetic diversity of SRLV strains circulating in the province of Ontario and show that the gag region is suitable for phylogenetic studies and may be applied to monitor SRLV eradication programs."

SPaV1 was detected in fecal samples from 51/75 healthy piglets (68% of the animals) and in none of the 25 fecal samples from healthy sows, indicating that SPaV1 circulates through enteric infection of healthy piglets.

To assess the potential for similar outbreaks in the future, we determined the antigenicity of H2 hemagglutinins (HAs) from representative human and avian H2 viruses and then analyzed the nucleotide and amino acid sequences to determine their evolutionary characteristics in different hosts. The results of longitudinal virus surveillance studies were also examined to estimate the prevalence of avian H2 isolates among samples collected from wild ducks and domestic poultry. Reactivity patterns obtained with a large panel of monoclonal antibodies indicated antigenic drift in the HA of human H2 influenza viruses, beginning in 1962. Amino acid changes were clustered in two regions of HA1 that correspond to antigenic sites A and D of the H3 HA. By contrast, the antigenic profiles of the majority of avian H2 HAs were remarkably conserved through 1991, resembling the prototype Japan 57 (H2N2) strain. Amino acid changes were distributed throughout HA1, indicating that antibodies do not play a major role in the selection of avian H2 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two geographic site-specific lineages of avian H2 HAs: North American and Eurasian. Evidence is presented to support interregion transmission of gull H2 viruses. The human H2 HAs that circulated in 1957-1968 form a separate phylogenetic lineage, most closely related to the Eurasian avian H2 HAs. There was an increased prevalence of H2 influenza viruses among wild ducks in 1988 in North America, preceding the appearance of H2N2 viruses in domestic fowl. As the prevalence of avian H2N2 influenza viruses increased on turkey farms and in live bird markets in New York City and elsewhere, greater numbers of these viruses have come into direct contact with susceptible humans. We conclude that antigenically conserved counterparts of the human Asian pandemic strain of 1957 continue to circulate in the avian reservoir and are coming into closer proximity to susceptible human populations."

Although the involvement of porcine NoVs in disease in pigs is unclear, they are genetically and antigenically closely related to human NoVs. Human NoV-like strains have been detected in pigs, raising public health concerns of potential interspecies transmission. Porcine SaVs are highly diverse and emerging in swine populations. Recently, at least three new genogroups of porcine SaVs have been proposed. In this study, we tested 413 pooled fecal samples collected from apparently healthy finisher pigs in North Carolina swine farms during 2009. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR coupled hybridization assays were performed to detect known porcine NoVs. The overall prevalence of porcine NoVs determined was 18.9% based on this method. Samples were then tested by RT-PCR targeting the 5' end of the capsid region for genogroup II (GII) NoVs, a group which includes human NoVs, followed by sequence analysis. All NoVs identified belonged to typical porcine NoV genotypes, and no human NoV-like strains were detected in specimens from these pigs. Porcine NoV-negative samples (n = 335) were subsequently screened using universal calicivirus primers, and 17 SaV strains were confirmed by sequencing. Based on the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region, they clustered with GIII, GVII, and GVIII and with currently unclassified SaVs. According to analysis of the complete capsid sequences, 7 representative strains clustered with GVII, GVIII, and GIX? SaVs. We tentatively classified SaVs into 14 genogroups based on the complete capsid protein VP1. In summary, porcine NoVs and highly divergent SaVs were present in North Carolina finisher pigs."

Characteristic hybridization probes from reference phages P22, ES18 and E. coli phage lambda were chosen. Four probes selected from the lysis region examined the dispersal of the lambdoid lysis genes. Other probes characterized were the replication genes and part of the structural genes. The complex immunity region was investigated by means of hybridization as well as biological tests. The results showed the relationship of the isolated phages to the P22 branch of the lambdoid phages and revealed their modular genome organization consisting of different proportions of P22-related sequences. DNA restriction patterns of phages released from Salmonella strains sampled in limited geographical areas were significantly less heterogeneous than those of phages released from the worldwide sampled SARA collection. The use of prophage restriction patterns as a tool for the typing of Salmonellae to support the epidemiologic classification of pathogenic strains is discussed."

HBoV has since been shown to be extremely common worldwide and to cause a systemic infection in small children often resulting in respiratory disease. Three more, presumably enteric, human bocaviruses (HBoV2-4) have been identified in stool samples. Parvoviruses are assumed to replicate via their genomic terminal hairpin-like structures in a so-called 'rolling-hairpin model'. These terminal sequences have recently been partially identified in head-to-tail HBoV-PCR amplicons from clinical samples, and are most likely hybrid relics of HBoV's predecessors, namely bovine parvovirus 1 on the left-hand side and minute virus of canines on the right, shown for the first time in this article. Thereby, the replication model postulated for HBoV remains questionable as the occurrence of head-to-tail sequences is not a typical feature of the rolling-hairpin replication model. However, such episomes can also be persistent storage forms of the genome."

These include ungulate protoparvovirus 1 (classical porcine parvovirus, PPV), ungulate tetraparvovirus 2 (PPV3), ungulate tetraparvovirus 3 (which includes PPV2, porcine hokovirus, porcine partetravirus and porcine PARV4), ungulate copiparvovirus 2 (which includes PPV4 and PPV5), ungulate bocaparvovirus 2 (which includes porcine bocavirus 1, 2 and 6), ungulate bocaparvovirus 3 (porcine bocavirus 5), ungulate bocaparvovirus 4 (porcine bocavirus 7) and ungulate bocaparvovirus 5 (porcine bocavirus 3, 4-1 and 4-2). PPV6, the most recently described porcine parvovirus, was first identified in China in late 2014 in aborted pig fetuses. Prevalence of PPV6 in China was found to be similar in finishing age pigs from farms with and without evidence of swine reproductive failure. Porcine parvovirus 6 (PPV6) was detected by sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and confirmed by overlapping and real-time PCR in the serum of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSv) positive samples. Seven nearly complete genomes of PPV6 were identified in PRRSv genotype 2 positive serum samples submitted to state veterinary diagnostic laboratories in 2014. Further testing using overlapping and real-time PCR determined PPV6 to be present in 13.2Â % of the serums tested. Additionally, PPV6 was present in samples from all of the geographic locations sampled encompassing nine states in the United States and one state in Mexico. The presence of PPV6 in serum indicates that the PPV6 infection is disseminated and not localized to a specific tissue type. Alignments of the near full length genomes, NS1, and capsid genes identified one of the five PPV6 isolates from China (98.6-99.5Â % identity with the North American strains) to be the North American strains nearest relative. These results are the first to report the presence of PPV6 in North America and demonstrate that the virus is found in multiple geographic areas in the United States and in Mexico. The overall prevalence of PPV6 in PRRSv viremic animals is relatively low. Further, all of the PPV6 genomes found in North America are most closely related to a PPV6 strain first identified in 2014 in healthy pigs from the Tianjin province of China."

In many cases, the causative agent cannot be identified, because the pathogens are unknown or detection methods are not routinely available. In our case, a 15-month-old cow developed central nervous disorders and died within 6 days after the onset of clinical signs. The histopathology revealed an acute encephalitis, predominantly in the brain stem, and a ganglionitis of the trigeminal ganglion with massive neuronal necroses in both the brain and the ganglion. However, a relevant panel of bacterial and viral infections of cattle could be routinely excluded. Therefore, a brain sample from the cow was analysed using a metagenomics approach with next-generation sequencing. A novel bovine astrovirus (BoAstV-BH89/14) could be identified using the analysis pipeline RIEMS, and the finding could be confirmed with a specific BoAstV RT-qPCR. The genome of the bovine astrovirus (BoAstV), belonging to the family Astroviridae in the genus Mamastrovirus, has a length of 6478 bp. Sequence identities between 71% to a sheep astrovirus and 69% to two recently described bovine astroviruses from the USA and Switzerland were ascertained. The latter were also connected to encephalitis cases in cattle. Like these, the new virus described here was detected in different brain sections using the specific BoAstV RT-qPCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization. In conclusion, while astroviruses so far were mainly found in relation to gastroenteritis in animals and humans, recently detected astrovirus infections were also related to encephalitis."

Here, samples collected from 263 German cattle kept in 22 different holdings were analysed for the presence of hepacivirus N (syn. bovine hepacivirus; BovHepV). One hundred eighty-six cattle that suffered from unspecific clinical signs such as fever and a reduced milk yield as well as 77 apparently healthy animals were included. A total of 39 cattle (14.8%) tested positive for BovHepV by real-time RT-PCR, but a correlation between clinical signs and virus infection could not be found. From 31 of the virus-positive samples, sequences of the NS3 coding region were generated and from two samples, viral sequences of the complete coding region were produced and compared to further European and African BovHepV sequences. Based on the NS3 genomic region, two distinct German BovHepV clusters were identified which differed between each other up to 20% at the nucleotide level, the diversity within the individual clusters reached up to 10%. Based on the full-length sequences, the newly detected virus variants group together with further German and African viruses in a sister relationship to other hepaciviruses from primates and further mammalians, but form distinct clusters within the BovHepV branch. In conclusion, highly diverse hepaciviruses were detected in German cattle further expanding the known phylogenetic diversity of the genus Hepacivirus."

(2) New viruses evolve relatively slowly by stepwise mutation and selection, for example, during antigenic or genetic drift. Influenza A viruses were found in various vertebrate species, where they form reservoirs that do not easily mix. While human influenza A viruses do not spread in birds and vice versa, the species barrier to pigs is relatively low, so that pigs might function as ""mixing vessels"" for the creation of new pandemic reassortants in Southeast Asia, where the probability is greatest for double infection of pigs by human and avian influenza viruses. Phylogenetic studies revealed that about 100 years ago, an avian influenza A virus had crossed the species barrier, presumably first to pigs, and from there to humans, forming the new stable human and classical swine lineages. In 1979, again, an avian virus showed up in the North European swine population, forming another stable swine lineage. The North European swine isolates from 1979 until about 1985 were genetically extremely unstable. A hypothesis is put forward stating that a mutator mutation is necessary to enable influenza virus to cross the species barrier by providing the new host with sufficient variants from which it can select the best fitting ones. As long as the mutator mutation is still present, such a virus should be able to cross the species barrier a second time, as happened about 100 years ago. Although the most recent swine isolates from northern Germany are again genetically stable, we nevertheless should be on the lookout to see if a North European swine virus shows up in the human population in the near future."

            spp. (tree shrew) was determined. Tree shrews are taxonomically assumed to be at the base of the phylogenetic tree of mammals and are frequently used as laboratory animals in neurological and behavior research. The TAV genome is 33,501 bp in length with a G+C content of 49.96% and has 166-bp inverted terminal repeats. Analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence resulted in the identification of 109 open reading frames (ORFs) with a coding capacity of at least 40 amino acid residues. Thirty-eight of them are predicted to encode viral proteins based on the presence of transcription and translation signals and sequence and positional conservation. Thirty viral ORFs were found to show significant similarities to known adenoviral genes, arranged into discrete early and late genome regions as they are known from mastadenoviruses. Analysis of the nucleotide content of the TAV genome revealed a significant CG dinucleotide depletion at the genome ends that suggests methylation of these genomic regions during the viral life cycle. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral gene products, including penton and hexon proteins, viral protease, terminal protein, protein VIII, DNA polymerase, protein IVa2, and 100,000-molecular-weight protein, revealed that the evolutionary lineage of TAV forms a separate branch within the phylogenetic tree of the

As most (re-)emerging viral infections originate from animal sources, it is important to obtain insight into viral pathogens present in the wildlife reservoir from a public health perspective. When monitoring living, free-ranging wildlife for viruses, sample collection can be challenging and availability of nucleic acids isolated from samples is often limited. The development of viral metagenomics platforms allows a more comprehensive inventory of viruses present in wildlife. We report a metagenomic viral survey of the Western Arctic herd of barren ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) in Alaska, USA. The presence of mammalian viruses in eye and nose swabs of 39 free-ranging caribou was investigated by random amplification combined with a metagenomic analysis approach that applied exhaustive iterative assembly of sequencing results to define taxonomic units of each metagenome. Through homology search methods we identified the presence of several mammalian viruses, including different papillomaviruses, a novel parvovirus, polyomavirus, and a virus that potentially represents a member of a novel genus in the family Coronaviridae."

These single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses are highly variable both genetically and antigenically. Several animal enteric caliciviruses that are morphologically indistinguishable and genetically closely related to human noroviruses have been identified. The first bovine enteric noroviruses were described in Great Britain and are known as Newbury Agent 2. At least three genetic clusters of porcine noroviruses join together within genogroup II noroviruses. Human noroviruses are the most important cause of acute gastroenteritis illness in people of all ages. In the USA, they are associated with approximately 30-50% of all food-borne outbreaks. Until now, noroviruses have not been associated with gastroenteritis outbreaks in immunocompetent animals. Neither bovine nor porcine noroviruses can replicate in cell culture, although human norovirus can grow in a complex 3D culture system. However, the recently discovered murine noroviruses can replicate in cell culture and are therefore used as model viruses to study human noroviruses. This review focusses on virus classification, virion structure, pathogenesis, epidemiology, immune response and diagnosis of animal noroviruses in comparison with human noroviruses. The classification of animal enteric caliciviruses within the Norovirus genus raises the question of whether transmission from an animal reservoir to humans could occur. Answering this question is important in determining the risk of cross-species infections affecting the epidemiology and evolution of these viruses and so complicating the control of human norovirus infections."

The virus is classified as a member of the order Mononegavirales in the family Paramyxoviridae of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae. Two interactive surface glycoproteins, the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins, play essential roles in NDV attachment and fusion of cells during infection. Antibodies to the F or HN proteins are capable of virus neutralization; however, no full-length sequences are available for these genes from recently obtained virulent isolates. Therefore, nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the F and HN protein genes from 16 NDV isolates representing highly virulent viruses from worldwide sources were obtained for comparison to older virulent isolates and vaccine strains. The F protein amino acid sequence was relatively conserved among isolates maintaining potential glycosylation sites and C residues for disulfide bonds. A dibasic amino acid motif was present at the cleavage site among more virulent isolates, while the low virulence viruses did not have this sequence. However, a Eurasian collared dove virus had a K114Q substitution at the F cleavage site unique among NDV isolates. The HN protein among NDV isolates maintained predicted catalytic and active site residues necessary for neuraminidase activity and hemagglutination. Length of the HN for the Eurasian collared dove isolate and a previously reported heat resistant virulent isolate were longer relative to other more recent virulent isolates. Phylogenetically NDV isolates separated into four groups with more recent virulent isolates forming a diverse branch, while all the avian paramyxoviruses formed their own clade distinct from other members of the Paramyxoviridae."

One exception was a recently developed NDV vaccine isolated from turkeys that had a thermostability of 15 min. Neuraminidase activity, as measured by elution rate of agglutinated red blood cells, varied among vaccine viruses and correlated with that of the parent isolate. Virulence as measured by intracerebral pathogenicity index ranged from 0 to 0.39 among NDV vaccine-type viruses, well within the range of avirulent lentogens. Sequence of the fusion protein cleavage site from all the NDV vaccine isolates examined was consistent with that for lentogens. The entire hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene sequence was 98% similar among all the NDV vaccine viruses examined and phylogenetic classification of commercial vaccine types correlated with their respective parent virus.

In 1993 the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses rearranged the order of the Paramyxovirus genus and placed NDV within the Rubulavirus genus among the Paramyxovirinae. The enveloped virus has a negative sense single-stranded RNA genome of 15,186 kb which codes for an RNA directed RNA polymerase, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein, fusion protein, matrix protein, phosphoprotein and nucleoprotein in the 5' to 3' direction. The virus has a wide host range with most orders of birds reported to have been infected by NDV. Isolates are characterized by virulence in chickens and are categorized into three main pathotypes depending on severity of disease. Lentogenic isolates are of low virulence while viruses of intermediate virulence are termed mesogenic. Highly virulent viruses that cause high mortality in birds are termed neurotropic or viscerotropic velogenic. Velogenic NDV are List A pathogens that require reporting to the Office of International Epizootics and outbreaks result in strict trade embargoes. The primary molecular determinant for NDV pathogenicity is the fusion protein cleavage site amino acid sequence.

Matrix (M) and fusion (F) protein genes of these isolates were examined for sequence heterogeneity and compared with European APV subtypes A and B. Among US isolates the M gene shared greater than 98% nucleotide sequence identity with only one nonsynonymous change occurring in a single US isolate. Although the F gene among US APV isolates shared 98% nucleotide sequence identity, nine conserved substitutions were detected in the predicted amino acid sequence. The predicted amino acid sequence of the US APV isolate's F protein had 72% sequence identity to the F protein of APV subtype A and 71% sequence identity to the F protein of APV subtype B. This compares with 83% sequence identity between the APV subtype A and B predicted amino acid sequences of the F protein. The US isolates were phylogenetically distinguishable from their European counterparts based on F gene nucleotide or predicted amino acid sequences. Lack of sequence heterogeneity among US APV subtypes indicates these viruses have maintained a relatively stable population since the first outbreak of TRT.

However, the isolates failed to react with a monoclonal antibody that has specificity for a wide variety of APMV-1 isolates. Although only highly virulent isolates require reporting to international regulatory agencies, the ability to correctly identify APMV-1 types is important for control and regulatory purposes. Protein gel patterns of the purified isolates resembled previously reported APMV-1 and anti-NDV polyclonal sera recognized the viral proteins. For three isolates oligonucleotide primers specific for the nucleoprotein, fusion protein and polymerase genes of NDV were utilized to synthesize cDNA using viral RNA as a template. Approximately 12kb of the genome was subsequently sequenced for the three isolates that included the nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrix protein, fusion (F) protein, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein genes and a 5' portion of the polymerase gene.

The Caribbean island of Trinidad experiences periodic outbreaks within the livestock population. We performed molecular characterisation of Trinidad rabies virus (RABV) and used a Bayesian phylogeographic approach to investigate the extent to which outbreaks are a result of in situ evolution versus importation of virus from the nearby South American mainland. Trinidadian RABV sequences were confirmed as bat variant and clustered with Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat) related sequences. They fell into two largely temporally defined lineages designated Trinidad I and II. The Trinidad I lineage which included sequences from 1997-2000 (all but two of which were from the northeast of the island) was most closely related to RABV from Ecuador (2005, 2007), French Guiana (1990) and Venezuela (1993, 1994). Trinidad II comprised sequences from the southwest of the island, which clustered into two groups: Trinidad IIa, which included one sequence each from 2000 and 2007, and Trinidad IIb including all 2010 sequences. The Trinidad II sequences were most closely related to sequences from Brazil (1999, 2004) and Uruguay (2007, 2008). Phylogeographic analyses support three separate RABV introductions from the mainland from which each of the three Trinidadian lineages arose. The estimated dates for the introductions and subsequent lineage expansions suggest periods of in situ evolution within Trinidad following each introduction. These data also indicate co-circulation of Trinidad lineage I and IIa during 2000. In light of these findings and the likely vampire bat origin of Trinidadian RABV, further studies should be conducted to investigate the relationship between RABV spatiotemporal dynamics and vampire bat population ecology, in particular any movement between the mainland and Trinidad."

In total, 36.6% of 287 caecal samples (nâ¯=â¯105; 95% CI: 14-59.2) were Campylobacter positive. Using PCR, 62.6% of samples (nâ¯=â¯99) were identified as C.Â coli and 37.4% as C.Â jejuni. HiMLST (nâ¯=â¯80) identified 19 different STs. ST-828 (nâ¯=â¯19) was the most common, followed by ST-827 (nâ¯=â¯12) and ST19 (nâ¯=â¯7). Sixteen of the 19 STs isolated are present in humans and eight are C.Â coli STs that account for 6.96% of human infections, although the overall risk to public health from pheasant meat is still considered to be low."

In the present study 205 tracheal swabs and organs were collected from broilers and layers chicken farms during January to August 2012 from 19 governorates all over Egypt. The chickens demonstrated respiratory signs and mortality. Out of the examined samples, 130 of which (about 64%) of suspected farms were positive for IBV with real time RT-PCR. 13 IBV-positive samples were selected for further isolation and characterization. Isolation in specific pathogen free (SPF) embryos was carried out after studies three blind successive passages and the hypervariable region of spike protein1 (SP1) was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced to study the genetic diversity between the isolated viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the obtained sequences of 13 isolates compared with other IBV strains from the Middle East and worldwide reveled that 11 out of the 13 isolates had close relationship the Israeli variants (IS/885 and IS/1494/06) with nucleotide homology reached up to 89.9% and 82.3%, respectively. Only two isolates had close relationship with CR/88121 and 4/91 viruses with identities of 95% and 96%, respectively. This study indicates existence of two variant groups of IBV circulating in Egypt during 2012. Group I was similar but distinguishable from Israeli variant IS/885 and group II was related to 4/91 and CR/88121 vaccine strains. There was no geographical link between the 2 groups as they were distributed all over the country. These findings necessitate the need to revise the vaccination programs and control measures for IBV."

The disease is endemic in Pakistan and recurrent outbreaks are being reported regularly in wild captive, rural and commercial poultry flocks. Though, efforts have been made to characterize the causative agent in some of parts of the country, the genetic nature of strains circulating throughout Pakistan is currently lacking. To ascertain the genetics of NDV, 452 blood samples were collected from 113 flocks, originating from all the provinces of Pakistan, showing high mortality (30-80%). The samples represented domesticated poultry (broiler, layer and rural) as well as wild captive birds (pigeons, turkeys, pheasants and peacock). Samples were screened with real-time PCR for both matrix and fusion genes (1792 bp), positive samples were subjected to amplification of full fusion gene and subsequent sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The deduced amino acid sequence of the fusion protein cleavage site indicated the presence of motif (112RK/RQRRâF117) typical for velogenic strains of NDV. Phylogenetic analysis of hypervariable region of the fusion gene indicated that all the isolates belong to lineage 5 of NDV except isolates collected from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province. A higher resolution of the phylogenetic analysis of lineage 5 showed the distribution of Pakistani NDV strains to 5b. However, the isolates from KPK belonged to lineage 4c; the first report of such lineage from this province. Taken together, data indicated the prevalence of multiple lineages of NDV in different poultry population including wild captive birds. Such understanding is crucial to underpin the nature of circulating strains of NDV, their potential for interspecies transmission and disease diagnosis and control strategies."

Infections with both autonomous and helper-virus dependent parvoviruses are common in both human and animal populations, and many animals are host to a number of different parvoviral species. Despite the epidemiological importance of parvoviruses, the presence and role of genome recombination within or among parvoviral species has not been well characterized. Here we show that natural recombination may be widespread in these viruses. Different genome regions of both porcine parvoviruses and Aleutian mink disease viruses have conflicting phylogenetic histories, providing evidence for recombination within each of these two species. Further, the rodent parvoviruses show complex evolutionary histories for separate genomic regions, suggesting recombination at the interspecies level."

Forty-five isolates, forming five sequence clusters, were unclassifiable by the present classification. Pairwise DNA distance analysis indicated different categories of relatedness, requiring a new classification system. We propose four principal sequence groups, A-D, which differ by 25-37%. Groups A and B are further divided into subtypes which differ by 15-27%. Group D and four of the seven group A subtypes, A3, A4, A5 and A7, are formed by new Swiss isolates. Molecular epidemiology revealed that Swiss B1 strains differed no more from French, Brazilian or US strains than from each other, suggesting virus propagation through international livestock trade. Furthermore, infection of goats by subtypes A3 or A4 was significantly associated with documented contact with sheep, which also harbor these subtypes, thus indicating regularly occurring sheep-to-goat transmission."

The same viral agents have also been detected in healthy flocks bringing into question their role in health and disease. In order to understand better eukaryotic viruses in the gut, this project focused on evaluating alternative methods to purify and concentrate viral particles, which do not involve the use of density gradients, for generating viral metagenome data. In this study, the sequence outcomes of three tissue processing methods have been evaluated and a data analysis pipeline has been established for RNA viruses from the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, with the use of the best method and increased sequencing depth, a glimpse of the RNA viral community in the gastrointestinal tract of a clinically normal 5-week old turkey is presented. The viruses from the Reoviridae and Astroviridae families together accounted for 76.3% of total viruses identified. The rarefaction curve at the species level further indicated that majority of the species diversity was included with the increased sequencing depth, implying that viruses from other viral families were present in very low abundance."

Modern farming conditions may also increase viral transmission and potential zoonotic spread. We describe here the metagenomics-derived virome in the feces of 24 healthy and 12 diarrheic piglets on a high-density farm. An average of 4.2 different mammalian viruses were shed by healthy piglets, reflecting a high level of asymptomatic infections. Diarrheic pigs shed an average of 5.4 different mammalian viruses. Ninety-nine percent of the viral sequences were related to the RNA virus families Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, and Caliciviridae, while 1% were related to the small DNA virus families Circoviridae, and Parvoviridae. Porcine RNA viruses identified, in order of decreasing number of sequence reads, consisted of kobuviruses, astroviruses, enteroviruses, sapoviruses, sapeloviruses, coronaviruses, bocaviruses, and teschoviruses. The near-full genomes of multiple novel species of porcine astroviruses and bocaviruses were generated and phylogenetically analyzed. Multiple small circular DNA genomes encoding replicase proteins plus two highly divergent members of the Picornavirales order were also characterized. The possible origin of these viral genomes from pig-infecting protozoans and nematodes, based on closest sequence similarities, is discussed. In summary, an unbiased survey of viruses in the feces of intensely farmed animals revealed frequent coinfections with a highly diverse set of viruses providing favorable conditions for viral recombination. Viral surveys of animals can readily document the circulation of known and new viruses, facilitating the detection of emerging viruses and prospective evaluation of their pathogenic and zoonotic potentials."

Northwest China has a sparse pig population and there is no comprehensive information currently available on PRRSV infection. In this study, we analyzed the epidemiological features and genetic diversity of PRRSV from this region. 322 field-isolated tissues or serum samples were collected from aborted pig fetuses or pigs with respiratory disease from 15 herds, twice over a period of 2 years. PRRSV infection was determined and virus strains were classified by the sequencing of GP5. We found that 35.9 % of the animals were PRRSV-positive, and the average prevalence in 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 was 46.5 and 29.3 %, respectively. To further investigate the genetic divergence of PRRSV samples collected from 2007 to 2010, 32 strains were isolated for GP5 sequencing and analysis, and phylogenetic trees were created based on GP5 amino acid sequences. All PRRSVs were of the North American genotype and belonged to the highly pathogenic HP-PRRSV subgenotype. Isolates from the Xinjiang province formed a tightly clustered branch and were closely related to an evolutionary intermediate subgroup isolate. Virus sequences from 2007 to 2008 were compared with those from 2009 to 2010 from the same herd. New mutations were found in isolates after 2009 and focused on nucleotides in the GP5 antibody decoy epitope. PRRSV strains in Northwest China from 2007 to 2010 were similar to those from other regions of China, with some regional characteristics. These results contribute to the knowledge of PRRSV epidemiology in China."

We developed a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) 1536-well plate assay to screen for entry inhibitors of Ebola virus-like particles (VLPs) containing the glycoprotein (GP) and the matrix VP40 protein fused to a beta-lactamase reporter protein and applied this assay for a rapid drug repurposing screen of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. We report here the identification of 53 drugs with activity of blocking Ebola VLP entry into cells. These 53 active compounds can be divided into categories including microtubule inhibitors, estrogen receptor modulators, antihistamines, antipsychotics, pump/channel antagonists, and anticancer/antibiotics. Several of these compounds, including microtubule inhibitors and estrogen receptor modulators, had previously been reported to be active in BSL-4 infectious Ebola virus replication assays and in animal model studies.

In the course of its evolution, the virus acquired many mutations and multiple unidentified molecular determinants are likely responsible for the ability of the 2009 H1N1 virus to cause increased disease severity in humans. Availability of limited data on complete genome hampers the continuous monitoring of this type of events. Outbreaks with considerable morbidity and mortality have been reported from all parts of the country. Considering a large number of clinical cases of infection complete genome based sequence characterization of Indian H1N1pdm virus and their phylogenetic analysis with respect to circulating global viruses was undertaken, to reveal the phylodynamic pattern of H1N1pdm virus in India from 2009-2011. The Clade VII was observed as a major circulating clade in phylogenetic analysis. Selection pressure analysis revealed 18 positively selected sites in major surface proteins of H1N1pdm virus. This study clearly revealed that clade VII has been identified as recent circulating clade in India as well globally. Few clade VII specific well identified markers undergone positive selection during virus evolution. Continuous monitoring of the H1N1pdm virus is warranted to track of the virus evolution and further transmission.

               <jats:p>Viral genomes often contain genes recently acquired from microbes. In some cases (for example, psbA) the proteins encoded by these genes have been shown to be important for viral replication. In this study, using a unique search strategy on the Global Ocean Survey (GOS) metagenomes in combination with marine virome and microbiome pyrosequencing-based datasets, we characterize previously undetected microbial metabolic capabilities concealed within the genomes of uncultured marine viral communities. A total of 34 microbial gene families were detected on 452 viral GOS scaffolds. The majority of auxiliary metabolic genes found on these scaffolds have never been reported in phages. Host genes detected in viruses were mainly divided between genes encoding for different energy metabolism pathways, such as electron transport and newly identified photosystem genes, or translation and post-translation mechanism related. Our findings suggest previously undetected ways, in which marine phages adapt to their hosts and improve their fitness, including translation and post-translation level control over the host rather than the already known transcription level control.</jats:p>"

Up to now, although few complete nucleotide sequences of PHEV have been reported, they are not annotated. This study aimed to illuminate genome characterization, phylogenesis and pathogenicity of the PHEV/2008 strain. The full length of the PHEV/2008 strain genome was 30,684Â bp, with a Gâ+âC content of 37.27%.

However, the origin and molecular characterization of this virus, A/Taiwan/2/2013 (H6N1), have not been well studied thus far. In the present report, we performed phylogenetic and coalescent analyses of this virus and compared its molecular profile/characteristics with other closely related strains. Molecular characterization of H6N1 revealed that it is a typical avian influenza virus of low pathogenicity, which might not replicate and propagate well in the upper airway in mammals. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus clusters with A/chicken/Taiwan/A2837/2013 (H6N1) in seven genes, except PB1. For the PB1 gene, A/Taiwan/2/2013 was clustered with a different H6N1 lineage from A/chicken/Taiwan/ A2837/2013. Although a previous study demonstrated that the PB2, PA, and M genes of A/Taiwan/2/2013 might be derived from the H5N2 viruses, coalescent analyses revealed that these H5N2 viruses were derived from more recent strains than that of the ancestor of A/Taiwan/2/2013. Therefore, we propose that A/Taiwan/2/2013 is a reassortant from different H6N1 lineages circulating in chickens in Taiwan. Furthermore, compared to avian isolates, a single P186L (H3 numbering) substitution in the hemagglutinin H6 of the human isolate might increase the mammalian receptor binding and, hence, this strain's pathogenicity in humans.

However, its co-circulation and potential reassortment with other influenza subtypes are still worthy of attention."

These H7N9 virus isolates were phylogenetically closely related to those prevailing in China. Antigenic analysis revealed that the hemagglutinin of the H7N9 HPAIV isolate was slightly different from those of the H7N9 LPAIV and older H7 strains. These meat products contaminated with AIVs repeatedly brought into Japan lead to increased risks of poultry and public health. Continuous border disease control based on the detection and culling of infected poultry and meat products is, thus, essential for the prevention of introduction and spread of AIVs."

However, in many cases, majority of the detected sequences originate from the host genome and bacterial flora in the gut. Here, to improve efficiency of the detection of double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses from samples, we evaluated the applicability of S1 nuclease on deep sequencing. Treating total RNA with S1 nuclease resulted in 1.5-28.4- and 10.1-208.9-fold increases in sequence reads of group A rotavirus in fecal and viral culture samples, respectively. Moreover, increasing coverage of mapping to reference sequences allowed for sufficient genotyping using analytical software. These results suggest that library construction using S1 nuclease is useful for deep sequencing in the detection of dsRNA viruses."

Interspecies transmission and genetic reassortment of influenza viruses have been implicated in the origin of these human pandemic influenza viruses. Pigs have been suspected to be the ""mixing vessel"" where reassortment occurs. To investigate this possibility, 104 porcine influenza viruses collected at random from Southern China from 1976 to 1982, including 32 H3N2 isolates and 72 H1N1 isolates, were studied using dot blot hybridization, partial sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. There were 29 of 32 H3N2 isolates characteristic of viruses originally derived from humans; the other 3 isolates were reassortants containing genes from porcine and human influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of the polymerase B1 (PB1) genes showed that interspecies transmission from humans to pigs has happened multiple times in pigs in Southern China. All 72 H1N1 isolates were of porcine origin characteristic of classical porcine H1N1 influenza virus. Analysis of 624 genes of porcine influenza viruses from Southern China failed to detect any evidence for avian influenza virus genes. This contrasts to what is currently found in Europe, where the majority of porcine influenza virus isolates are of avian origin."

Although molecular and sero-epidemiological investigations of HEV have been performed in many provinces in China, the epidemiological data from Yunnan Province are limited and genotypes are not be fully characterized. In this study the prevalence and characteristics of hepatitis E virus (HEV) detected in pigs from Yunnan province, China was evaluated. A total of 13 out of 187 pig fecal samples collected in 2011 revealed HEV positive results; likewise, 7 out of 69 samples collected in 2012 exhibited positive results. These findings indicated a total prevalence of 7.8% (20/256). Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analysis results revealed that nine strains were found in the samples obtained in 2011, in which 87.1% to 99.4% nucleotide sequence identity was shared among these strains; and 77.0% to 81.9%, 52.2% to 53.6%, 77.0% to 88.2% and 77.9% to 96.8% nucleotide sequence identities were shared with strains representing genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Blood samples from affected patients were sent for clinical analysis to determine the actual cause of the illness, but reports were inconclusive. The present study describes the clinical observations and laboratory investigations involving molecular methods performed on 170 of the 2000 clinically suspected cases. These were patients who were admitted to Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai, Tamil Nadu with ocular complications. Conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR, and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal gene amplification (RT-LAMP) assays were used to detect West Nile virus (WNV) infection. Further investigation of the genetic diversity of the WNV implicated in ocular complications was undertaken by sequence phylogeny. Out of 170 samples, 25 (15%) were positive for chikungunya IgM antibody, 10 (6%) for chikungunya antigen, and 30 (18%) were positive for dengue IgM antibody. The remaining 105 seronegative samples were further processed for WNV detection by IgM capture ELISA and molecular methods. Out of the 105 samples, 35 (33%) were positive for WNV IgM antibody, 15 (14%) were positive for WNV by RT-PCR, and 27 (26%) were found to be positive for WNV by both real-time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assays. Comparative evaluation with acute-phase patient serum samples revealed 100% concordance between the real-time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assays. These assays had an overall higher sensitivity than the conventional RT-PCR as they picked up 12 additional samples with a low copy number of template. Further genotyping through sequence phylogeny revealed that all the WNV isolates were grouped in lineage I. The association of West Nile virus with ocular infection in South India during an epidemic of mysterious fever in the first half of 2010 was clearly established through molecular approaches employing envelope gene-specific real-time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assays followed by nucleotide sequencing."

The genome consisted of 7225 nucleotides, excluding a poly-A tail at the 3' terminus, and contained three open reading frames (ORFs), ORF-1, ORF-2 and ORF-3, encoding 1702, 660 and 113 amino acids, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that SAAS-JDY5 belonged to genotype 3 HEV and was most closely related to the Japanese isolate wbJYG1 (AB222184). SAAS-JDY5 shared approximately 87% nucleotide similarity to human and swine strains from the United States, compared with 74-75% similarity to Asian (genotype 4) and Mexican strains (genotype 2).

In humans, TRIM5 is located in a paralogous cluster that includes TRIM6, TRIM34, and TRIM22. Although TRIM6 and TRIM34 orthologs are found in other mammals, TRIM5 has to date been identified only in primates. Cow cells exhibit early blocks to infection by several retroviruses. We identify a cytoplasmic TRIM protein encoded by LOC505265 that is responsible for the restriction of infection by several lentiviruses and N-tropic murine leukemia virus in cow cells. Susceptibility of N-tropic murine leukemia virus to 505265-mediated restriction is determined primarily by residue 110 of the viral capsid protein. Phylogenetically, cow LOC505265 segregates with the TRIM5/TRIM6/TRIM34 group, but is not an ortholog of known TRIM genes. The B30.2/SPRY domain of 505265 exhibits long variable regions, a characteristic of the proteins encoded by this paralogous group, and shows evidence of positive selection. Apparently, cows have independently evolved a retroviral restriction factor from the same TRIM family that spawned TRIM5 in primates. Particular features of this subset of cytoplasmic TRIM proteins may be conducive to the convergent evolution of virus-restricting factors."

Different isolates of H5N1 were sequenced to explore the genetic diversity of these viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed close clustering and highest sequence identity in all 8 genes to HPAI H5N1 isolates belonging to unified H5 clade 2.2, sub-lineage EMA-3 recovered from Afghanistan during the same time period. Two subgroups within Pakistani H5N1 viruses, from domestic and wild birds, were observed on the basis of their sequence homology and mutations. HPAI motif, preferred receptor specificity for Î±-(2, 3) linkages, potential N-linked glycosylation sites and an additional glycosylation site at the globular head of HA protein of four Pakistani H5N1 isolates. While, the amino acids associated with sensitivities to various antiviral drugs (Oseltamivir, Zanamivir, Amantadine) were found conserved for the Pakistani H5N1 isolates. Conspicuously, some important mutations observed at critical positions of antigenic sites (S141P, D155S, R162I & P181S) and at receptor binding pocket (A185T, R189K & S217P) of HA-1. A high sequence similarity between Pakistani HP H5N1 and LP H9N2 viruses was also observed. Avian like host specific markers with the exception of E627K in PB2, K356R in PA, V33I in NP, I28V in M2 and L107F in NS2 proteins were also observed. Various point mutations in different genes of H5 viruses from Pakistan were observed during its circulation in the field. The outbreaks started in Khyber Pakhtoon Khawa (North West) province in 2006 and spread to the Southern regions over a period of time. Though migratory birds may have a role for this continued endemicity of clade 2.2 H5N1 viruses during 2006-2008 in Pakistan, the possibility of their transmission through legal or illegal poultry trade across the borders cannot be ignored."

They could be distinguished from the nucleic acid of phage lambda added to the preparation as a marker for double-stranded configuration. Experiments in which the virus particles under investigation were incubated at pH 12.9 at 50 degrees C for 30 min revealed that their nucleic acid molecules were hydrolyzed as readily as the RNA genome of poliovirus type 2 analyzed in parallel. Both the single-stranded DNA of phage phiX174 and that of parvovirus LuIII, however, proved unaffected by this treatment, and the double-stranded DNA of phage lambda was denatured to single-stranded molecules.

Previous studies have suggested that human Wa-like RVAs share a close evolutionary relationship with porcine RVAs. Specifically, the VP1-VP3 and NSP2-5/6 genes of these viruses are usually classified as genotype 1 with >81% nucleotide sequence identity. Yet, it remains unknown whether the genotype 1 genes and proteins of human Wa-like strains are distinguishable from those of porcine strains. To investigate this, we performed comprehensive bioinformatic analyses using all known genotype 1 gene sequences. The RVAs analyzed represent wildtype strains isolated from humans or pigs at various geographical locations during the years of 2004-2013, including 11 newly-sequenced porcine RVAs from Brazil. We also analyzed archival strains that were isolated during the years of 1977-1992 as well as atypical strains involved in inter-species transmission between humans and pigs. We found that, in general, the genotype 1 genes of typical modern human Wa-like RVAs clustered together in phylogenetic trees and were separate from those of typical modern porcine RVAs. The only exception was for the NSP5/6 gene, which showed no host-specific phylogenetic clustering. Using amino acid sequence alignments, we identified 34 positions that differentiated the VP1-VP3, NSP2, and NSP3 genotype 1 proteins of typical modern human Wa-like RVAs versus typical modern porcine RVAs and documented how these positions vary in the archival/unusual isolates. No host-specific amino acid positions were identified for NSP4, NSP5, or NSP6. Altogether, the results of this study support the notion that human Wa-like RVAs and porcine RVAs are evolutionarily related, but indicate that some of their genotype 1 genes and proteins have diverged over time possibly as a reflection of sequestered replication and protein co-adaptation in their respective hosts."

Genome segment A encodes the capsid protein (VP2), while segment B encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (VP1). In the present study, we trace the molecular epidemiology of IBDV in Brazil by analyzing 29 isolates collected in the major regions of poultry production. To genetically characterize the isolates, phylogenetic and population dynamic analyses were conducted using 68 VP1 (2634 nt) and 102 VP2 (1356 nt) coding sequences from IBDV isolates from different regions of the world. Furthermore, the evolution of IBDV was analyzed by characterizing the selective forces that operated during the diversification of viral isolates. We show that IBDV isolates were introduced into Brazil mainly from the Netherlands and the USA. These introductions were associated with all Brazilian poultry production regions analyzed in this work. In addition, we show that the evolution of IBDV has been shaped by a combination of very low recombination rates and relatively high rates of nucleotide substitution (2.988Ã10(-4) for VP1 and 3.2937Ã10(-4) for VP2), which themselves are a function of purifying selection operating on VP1 and VP2. Furthermore, our extended Bayesian skyline plot suggests that the increase in the effective population size of isolates of IBDV is consistent with its epidemiological history, with a large increase during the emergence of acute outbreaks of IBD in the 1980s."

Six small RNA (sRNA) libraries were multiplexed in Ion Torrent PI chip and sequenced on Ion Proton System. The reads obtained were aligned to the Bos taurus genome (UMD3.1 assembly), which is phylogenetically closest species to buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). A total of 160 bovine miRNAs were biocomputationally identified in buffalo PBMCs and 130 putatively novel miRNAs (not enlisted in the bovine mirBase) were identified. All of these 290 miRNAs identified across the six treatment and control samples represent the repertoire of novel miRNAs for the buffalo species. The expression profiles of these miRNAs across the samples have been represented by sample dendrogram and heatmap plots. The uniquely expressed miRNAs in each treatment and control groups were identified. A few miRNAs were expressed at very high levels while the majority of them were moderately expressed.

After shotgun sequencing of the fecal microbiome, we used the SEED database to identify the microbial diversity and metabolic potential in low and high FCR birds. The domain-level breakdown of our samples was bacteria (>95Â %), eukaryotes (>2Â %), archaea (>0.2Â %), and viruses (>0.2Â %). At the phylum level, Proteobacteria (78.83Â % in low and 52.04Â % in high FCR), Firmicutes (11.97Â % in low and 27.53Â % in high FCR) and Bacteroidetes (7.10Â % in low FCR and 17.53Â % in high FCR) predominated in the fecal microbial community. Poultry fecal metagenomes revealed the sequences related to 33 genera in both low and high FCR with significantly different proportion. Functional analysis revealed that genes for the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids and derivatives and protein metabolism were most abundant in SEED subsystem in both samples. Genes associated with stress, virulence, cell wall and cell capsule were also abundant. Indeed, genes associated with sulphur assimilation, flagellum and flagellar motility were over represented in low FCR birds.

The SSO is a threatened subspecies under federal law and a fully protected species under California law, US. Through a multiagency collaborative program, stranded animals are rehabilitated and released, while deceased animals are necropsied and tissues are cryopreserved to facilitate scientific study. Here, we processed archival tissues to enrich particle-associated viral nucleic acids, which we randomly amplified and deeply sequenced to identify viral genomes through sequence similarities. Anelloviruses and endogenous retroviral sequences made up over 50% of observed viral sequences. Polyomavirus, parvovirus, and adenovirus sequences made up most of the remaining reads. We characterized and phylogenetically analyzed the full genome of sea otter polyomavirus 1 and the complete coding sequence of sea otter parvovirus 1 and found that the closest known viruses infect primates and domestic pigs ( Sus scrofa domesticus), respectively. We tested archived tissues from 69 stranded SSO necropsied over 14 yr (2000-13) by PCR. Polyomavirus, parvovirus, and adenovirus infections were detected in 51, 61, and 29% of examined animals, respectively, with no significant increase in frequency over time, suggesting endemic infection. We found that 80% of tested SSO were infected with at least one of the three DNA viruses, whose tissue distribution we determined in 261 tissue samples. Parvovirus DNA was most frequently detected in mesenteric lymph node, polyomavirus DNA in spleen, and adenovirus DNA in multiple tissues (spleen, retropharyngeal and mesenteric lymph node, lung, and liver). This study describes the virome in tissues of a threatened species and shows that stranded SSO are frequently infected with multiple viruses, warranting future research to investigate associations between these infections and observed lesions."

These conflicts arise because of differences in the viruses and genomic regions compared and in the methodology used. We have reexamined published sequences and found that synonymous substitutions were saturated in comparisons between and within virus genotypes. Analysis of complete genome sequences or concatenated ORF1/ORF2 amino acid sequences indicated that HEV variants most closely related to those infecting humans can be consistently divided into six genotypes (types 1 to 4 and two additional genotypes from wild boar). Variants isolated from rabbits, closely related to genotype 3, occupy an intermediate position. No consistent criteria could be defined for the assignment of virus subtypes. Analysis of amino acid sequences from these viruses with the more divergent variants from chickens, bats, and rodents in three conserved subgenomic regions (residues 1 to 452 or 974 to 1534 of ORF1 or residues 105 to 458 of ORF2) provided consistent support for a division into 4 groups, corresponding to HEV variants infecting humans and pigs, those infecting rats and ferrets, those from bats, and those from chickens. This approach may form the basis for a future genetic classification of HEV into four species, with the more divergent HEV-like virus from fish (cutthroat trout virus) representing a second genus."

Genetically, both viruses are heterogeneous and are classified into several genotypes that differ in their geographical distribution and risk group association. There is, however, little evidence that variants of HAV or HEV differ antigenically or in their propensity to cause severe disease. Genetically more divergent but primarily hepatotropic variants of both HAV and HEV have been found in several mammalian species, those of HAV being classified into eight species within the genus"

In the 20th century, 3 influenza viruses caused major pandemics: the 1918 H1N1 virus, the 1957 H2N2 virus, and the 1968 H3N2 virus. These pandemics were initiated by the introduction and successful adaptation of a novel hemagglutinin subtype to humans from an animal source, resulting in antigenic shift. Despite global concern regarding a new pandemic influenza, the emergence pathway of pandemic strains remains unknown. Here we estimated the evolutionary history and inferred date of introduction to humans of each of the genes for all 20th century pandemic influenza strains. Our results indicate that genetic components of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus circulated in mammalian hosts, i.e., swine and humans, as early as 1911 and was not likely to be a recently introduced avian virus. Phylogenetic relationships suggest that the A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 virus (BM/1918) was generated by reassortment between mammalian viruses and a previously circulating human strain, either in swine or, possibly, in humans. Furthermore, seasonal and classic swine H1N1 viruses were not derived directly from BM/1918, but their precursors co-circulated during the pandemic. Mean estimates of the time of most recent common ancestor also suggest that the H2N2 and H3N2 pandemic strains may have been generated through reassortment events in unknown mammalian hosts and involved multiple avian viruses preceding pandemic recognition. The possible generation of pandemic strains through a series of reassortment events in mammals over a period of years before pandemic recognition suggests that appropriate surveillance strategies for detection of precursor viruses may abort future pandemics."

Several recent studies hypothesized that bats, an ancient group of flying mammals, are the major reservoir of several important RNA virus families from which other mammalian viruses of livestock and humans were derived. Although this hypothesis needs further investigation, the premise that bats carry a large number of viruses is commonly accepted. The question of whether bats have unique biological features making them ideal reservoir hosts has been the subject of several recent reviews. In this review, we will focus on the public health implications of bat derived zoonotic viral disease outbreaks, examine the drivers and risk factors of past disease outbreaks and outline research directions for better control of future disease events."

The new assembly, together with camelpox and taterapox genomes, permitted new dates to be calculated for the last common ancestor of all VARV genomes. The analysis of recently sequenced VARV-like cowpox virus genomes showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and amino acid changes in the vaccinia virus (VACV)-Cop-O1L ortholog, predicted to be associated with VARV host specificity and virulence, were introduced into the lineage before the divergence of these viruses. A comparison of the ancient and modern VARV genome sequences also revealed a measurable drift towards adenine + thymine (A + T) richness.</jats:p>"

More recently CAstV has been implicated in cases of two other diseases of broilers as the sole etiological agent, namely severe kidney disease of young broilers with visceral gout and the ""White Chicks"" hatchery disease. Examination of the strains of CAstV associated with the two latter diseases reveals they are closely related genetically. This review will discuss the pathogenesis of CAstV in relation to strain diversity and the effects of vertical versus horizontal transmission, virus load, co-infections and age of bird at infection, all factors that may impact upon disease severity."

To determine the genetic relationship of Iranian viruses, neuraminidase (NA) genes from ten isolates of H9N2 viruses isolated from commercial chickens in Iran during 2008-2009 were amplified and sequenced. The viruses' neuraminidase gene was >90% similar to those of A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (H9N2) sublineage. The neuraminidase stalk regions in these Viruses had no deletion as compared to that of chicken/Beijing/1/94 sublineage (Beijing-like viruses) and the two human isolates A/HK/1073/99, A/HK/1074/99. Phylogenetic analysis of neuraminidase (NA) gene showed that it shares a common ancestor A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 isolate which had contributed the internal genes of the H5N1 virus. The results of this study indicated that No (Beijing-like) virus and (Korean-like) virus were found in chickens in Iran, and the NA genes of H9N2 influenza viruses circulating in Iran during the past years were well conserved and the earlier Iranian isolates may be considered to represent such a progenitor."

To determine the prevalence and origin of PR in Yunnan, especially among vaccinated pigs, overall 791 samples of blood, tissue, semen, and sera were analyzed by serological methods, PCR, and sequence analysis of gD gene. Detection with viral gI antibody or PCR showed that the yearly positive rates of PR virus (PRV) in Yunnan from 2010 to 2014 were 48.15, 21.26, 2.17, 5.22, and 0.35%, respectively, with an average of 15.43%. In general, the incidence declined through the period of 2010-2014 probably due to the application of PRV eradication strategies. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the complete sequence of gD gene, with all strains clustered into two independent clades, i.e., Asian and European-American clades. The virus isolates from Henan, Tianjin, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Shandong, Fujian, Xinjiang, Hubei, Guangdong, and Yunnan fell into Asian group, which harbored South Korea isolate. Four Yunnan virus isolates together with South Korean Namyangju fell into in the European-American clade. It showed that PR was pandemic as there was not a clear clue about the geographical origin of the PRV isolates in China since 2010."

Despite that they both belong to the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family, there are many differences in the infection process of these viruses. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Multiple studies indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) can play critical roles in the host-pathogen interaction. Our previous study reported that EV71 and CA16 infection leads to differential expression of miRNAs in human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells. Herein, we aimed to further explore the expression profile and possible roles of other differentially expressed miRNAs in 16HBE cells following EV71 and CA16 infections using high-throughput sequencing. We describe 44 novel differentially expressed miRNAs in all samples. Among these miRNAs, 7 novel differentially expressed miRNAs show an opposite expression trend during the progression of EV71 and CA16 infections. Subsequently, bioinformatics analyses, including Gene Oncology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases, were used to identify the biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, and pathways involved. The top 10 significant GO and Pathway annotations indicated that 849 target genes are involved in cell development, such as nervous system development, multicellular organism development, and developmental biology. Finally, the genes identified in both the GO and Pathway analysis were used to construct a co-expression network to further identify the potential function of these co-expressed genes. Thus, our data may be beneficial in guiding further studies on the molecular mechanism of developmental regulation in HFMD pathogenesis caused by EV71 and CA16. In addition, it provided new candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets for HFMD."

CA16 infection can also progress to central nervous system (CNS) complications; however, the underlying mechanism by which CA16 penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and then causes CNS damage remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of CA16 neurotropic tropism by establishing an in vitro BBB model with CA16 infection and an in vivo CA16 rhesus monkey infant infection model. The results showed that CA16 infection induced increased permeability of the BBB accompanied by upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) expression. Subsequently, high-throughput miRNA sequencing technology and bioinformatics analysis revealed that miR-1303 may regulate BBB permeability by targeting MMP9. Next, we used dual-luciferase, qRT-PCR, and western blot assays to provide evidence of MMP9 targeting by miR-1303. Further experiments revealed that CA16 infection promoted the degradation of junctional complexes (Claudin4, Claudin5, VE-Cadherin, and ZO-1), likely by downregulating miR-1303 and upregulating MMP9. Finally, EGFP-CA16 infection could enter the CNS by facilitating the degradation of junctional complexes, eventually causing neuroinflammation and injury to the CNS, which was confirmed using the in vivo rhesus monkey model. Our results indicate that CA16 might penetrate the BBB and then enter the CNS by downregulating miR-1303, which disrupts junctional complexes by directly regulating MMP9 and ultimately causing pathological CNS changes. These results provide new therapeutic targets in HFMD patients following CA16 infection."

Recently, the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) in pathogen-host interactions have been highlighted. In the present study, we performed comprehensive miRNA profiling in EV71- and CA16-infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) at multiple time points using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that 135 known miRNAs exhibited remarkable differences in expression. Of these, 30 differentially expressed miRNAs presented opposite trends in EV71- and CA16-infected samples. Subsequently, we mainly focused on the 30 key differentially expressed miRNAs through further screening to predict targets. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis of the predicted targets showed the enrichment of 14 biological processes, 9 molecular functions, 8 cellular components, and 85 pathways. The regulatory networks of these miRNAs with predicted targets, GOs, pathways, and co-expression genes were determined, suggesting that miRNAs display intricate regulatory mechanisms during the infection phase. Consequently, we specifically analyzed the hierarchical GO categories of the predicted targets involved in biological adhesion. The results indicated that the distinct changes induced by EV71 and CA16 infection may be partly linked to the function of the blood-brain barrier. Taken together, this is the first report describing miRNA expression profiles in HUVECs with EV71 and CA16 infections using high-throughput sequencing. Our data provide useful insights that may help to elucidate the different host-pathogen interactions following EV71 and CA16 infection and offer novel therapeutic targets for these infections."

Herein, we utilized microRNA (miRNA) deep sequencing to investigate the roles of novel differentially expressed miRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with EV71 and CA16. The results identified 13 novel differentially expressed miRNAs in each group. Additionally, the target genes were predicted by the miRanda and RNAhybrid programs, and a total of 2,501 targets were found in the two databases. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses revealed that these targets were mainly involved in cell development and were associated with nervous system development, system development, multicellular organism development, the Wnt signaling pathway, the PDGF signaling pathway, and the EGF receptor signaling pathway. Finally, a coexpression regulatory network was built with the key targets to further extrapolate the functional interactions of the targets and their coexpressed genes.

Since December 2009, pandemic (H1N1) 2009-like viruses have been isolated in pigs from different swine farms of South Korea. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of viral segments demonstrated several events of human-to-swine transmission with no apparent signs of reassortment. These events were also supported by serological surveillance in pig sera collected from April to December, suggesting that reverse transmission probably started between June and July with a drastic increase in prevalence the following months. Although molecular characterization indicates that the swine isolates are generally stable, some viruses are genetically evolving, most notably in their surface proteins. Animal studies (ferrets and mice) reveal that swine pandemic isolates epitomize biological properties attributed to the currently circulating human pandemic viruses, including replication kinetics and efficient transmission, indicating their potential to return to circulation among humans. Overall, these results indicate widespread human-to-animal transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza viruses in South Korea. With the significant role of pigs in the ecology of influenza viruses, these transmission events should be closely monitored and minimized to prevent the risk of generating viruses with greater human health concerns."

Upon cross-species transmission, AlHV-1 induces a fatal lymphoproliferative disease named malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) in many ruminants, including cattle, and the rabbit model. Latency has been shown to be essential for MCF induction. However, the mechanisms causing the activation and proliferation of infected CD8+T cells are unknown. Many c-HVs express microRNAs (miRNAs). These small non-coding RNAs can regulate expression of host or viral target genes involved in various pathways and are thought to facilitate viral infection and/or mediate activation and proliferation of infected lymphocytes. The AlHV-1 genome has been predicted to encode a large number of miRNAs. However, their precise contribution in viral infection and pathogenesis in vivo remains unknown. Here, using cloning and sequencing of small RNAs we identified 36 potential miRNAs expressed in a lymphoblastoid cell line propagated from a calf infected with AlHV-1 and developing MCF. Among the sequenced candidate miRNAs, 32 were expressed on the reverse strand of the genome in two main clusters. The expression of these 32 viral miRNAs was further validated using Northern blot and quantitative reverse transcription PCR in lymphoid organs of MCF developing calves or rabbits. To determine the concerted contribution in MCF of 28 viralmiRNAs clustered in the non-protein-coding region of the AlHV-1 genome, a recombinant virus was produced. The absence of these 28 miRNAs did not affect viral growth in vitro or MCF induction in rabbits, indicating that the AlHV-1 miRNAs clustered in this non-protein-coding genomic region are dispensable for MCF induction."

The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from all 6 H5N1 viruses and an additional 38 North American wild-bird-origin H5 subtype and 28 N1 subtype viruses were sequenced and compared with sequences available in GenBank by phylogenetic analysis. Both HA and NA were phylogenetically distinct from those for viruses from outside of North America and from those for viruses recovered from mammals. Four of the H5N1 AI viruses were characterized as low pathogenicity by standard in vivo pathotyping tests. One of the H5N1 viruses, A/MuteSwan/MI/451072-2/06, was shown to replicate to low titers in chickens, turkeys, and ducks. However, transmission of A/MuteSwan/MI/451072-2/06 was more efficient among ducks than among chickens or turkeys based on virus shed. The 50% chicken infectious dose for A/MuteSwan/MI/451072-2/06 and three other wild-waterfowl-origin H5 viruses were also determined and were between 10(5.3) and 10(7.5) 50% egg infective doses. Finally, seven H5 viruses representing different phylogenetic clades were evaluated for their antigenic relatedness by hemagglutination inhibition assay, showing that the antigenic relatedness was largely associated with geographic origin.

In total, 32.98 and 22.55% of the domestic pig samples were HEV-positive using RT-nPCR targeting the ORF1 and ORF2 fragments, respectively. Among ungulates, 25.94% of the wild boar samples, 22.58% of the roe deer samples, 6.67% of the red deer samples and 7.69% of the moose samples were positive for HEV RNA using primers targeting the ORF1 fragment. Using primers targeting the ORF2 fragment of the HEV genome, viral RNA was only detected in 17.03% of the wild boar samples and 12.90% of the roe deer samples. Phylogenetic analysis based on a 348-nucleotide-long region of the HEV ORF2 showed that all obtained sequences detected in Lithuanian domestic pigs and wildlife belonged to genotype 3. In this study, the sequences identified from pigs, wild boars and roe deer clustered within the 3i subtype reference sequences from the GenBank database. The sequences obtained from pig farms located in two different counties of Lithuania were of the HEV 3f subtype. The wild boar sequences clustered within subtypes 3i and 3h, clearly indicating that wild boars can harbor additional subtypes of HEV. For the first time, the ORF2 nucleotide sequences obtained from roe deer proved that HEV subtype 3i can be found in a novel host. The results of the viral prevalence and phylogenetic analyses clearly demonstrated viral infection in Lithuanian pigs and wild ungulates, thus highlighting a significant concern for zoonotic virus transmission through both the food chain and direct contact with animals. Unexpected HEV genotype 3 subtype diversity in Lithuania and neighboring countries revealed that further studies are necessary to understand the mode of HEV transmission between animals and humans in the Baltic States region."

Its nucleic acid is comprised of double-stranded RNA and adenosine-rich oligonucleotides. The dsRNA is distributed among 10 segments with molecular weights of 2.7 x 10(6), 2.6 x 10(6), 1.7 x 10(6), 1.5 x 10(6), 1.3 x 10(6), 1.2 x 10(6), 0.80 x 10(6), 0.74 x 10(6), and 0.68 x 10(6) for the largest (L1) to the smallest (S4) segment, respectively, as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These 10 segments migrate differently on polyacrylamide gels compared to those of human reovirus type 3.

It is a pathogen with worldwide distribution, causing significant financial losses in livestock production. The disease mainly affects sheep and goats, but various other ruminants and mammals have been reported to be infected as well. It is also a zoonotic disease, affecting mainly people who come in direct or indirect contact with infected animals (e.g. farmers, veterinarians). The disease is usually benign and self-limiting, although in many cases, especially in young animals, it can be persistent and even fatal. Production losses caused by Orf virus are believed to be underestimated, as it is not a notifiable disease. This review of literature presents all latest information regarding the virus; considerations regarding treatment and prevention will be also discussed."

All the samples were found to be positive for IBDV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the samples identified them as classic molecular group 3 and group 4 viruses. Two samples from each of the four flocks were sequenced, and within a flock, these sequences were identical; however, between flocks, some differences were observed. One virus from each of the four flocks was selected for further analysis. The VP2 hypervariable sequence region of samples GA-1, H-30, and CS-2-35 had nucleotide and amino acid similarities with the D78 and Vi Bursa G classic vaccines that were used in those flocks. The sequence of HPR-2 was similar to the Bursa Vac 4 vaccine used in that flock and the STC virulent classic IBDV strain. The deduced amino acid sequence of these isolates revealed that all the isolates had proline at position 222, which is characteristic of U.S. classic viruses. The phylogenetic analysis of these isolates on the basis of the VP2 hypervariable amino acid sequence clustered GA-1, H-30, and CS-2-35 with the D78 vaccine and HPR-2 with STC. The pathogenicity of these isolates was tested in specific-pathogen-free chickens. Bursa-body weight (B-BW) ratios and histopathologic lesion scores in the bursa were determined. Gross lesions were observed in the bursa, and the B-BW ratios of the birds infected with all four wild-type viruses were significantly different compared with the D78 vaccine and uninoculated control groups. Histopathology of the bursa from groups infected with GA-1, H-30, CS-2-35, and HPR-2 showed different degrees of follicular depletion and necrosis. A very slight lymphoid depletion was observed in the D78-infected group at 5 days postinoculation, and no microscopic lesions were observed in this group at 8 days postinoculation or at any time in the uninoculated control group. The bursa collected from the field virus and D78-infected birds at necropsy revealed the presence of IBDV via RT-PCR, and the VP-2 hypervariable nucleotide sequences of the GA-1, H-30, CS-2-35, HPR-2, and D78 samples were identical to the original viral isolates and vaccine, respectively."

Thirty four viruses, derived from Central European pigs or wild boar, were examined. All of these viruses were detected by each of three sets of oligonucleotide primers which had been designed for the specific RT-PCR amplification of different genomic regions. Comparative sequence analysis of the PCR products showed that they were of a genetic type common in Western Europe. Further discrimination of virus isolates was possible, into subgroups that largely coincided with their regions of origin in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Estonia. The discriminatory ability of the technique was improved by the analysis of a composite dataset consisting of all of the sequence data from all of the viruses. Using this approach we were able to distinguish between all of the viruses and to group them in a manner that precisely matched their geographical origins, apart from a single Estonian isolate which grouped with viruses from Eastern Poland."

A total of 1,050 serum samples were collected between 2014 and 2017 from sows and 3-20Â weeks old pigs from 14 commercial farms representing different regions of Poland, different size and health status. The samples were pooled by 4-6 and tested with real-time PCR for PCV3. PCV3 DNA was detected in 12 of 14 farms (85.7%). On the PCV3-positive farms, the virus was detected in 5.9% to 65% serum pools. PCV3 was most common among weaned pigs and finishers (26.1% and 28.0% of serum pools, respectively). Sequence analysis of 359 nucleotide fragment of ORF2 showed highest identity of 99.7% to PCV3-US/SD2016 from USA.

Although PRRSV is widespread in domestic swine, there is a lack of information regarding PRRSV infection in European wild boars (Sus scrofa). Currently available information does not provide conclusive evidence that wild boars are a reservoir of PRRSV. Nevertheless, wild boars may be likely to become infected by domestic swine through occasional direct or indirect contact. Furthermore, wild boars can act as a reservoir for infectious diseases of domestic pigs. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to determine the virus prevalence and further explore the epidemiology and diversity of PRRSV strains present in Lithuanian wild boars over a 5-year period. A total of 1597 tissue and serum samples from wild boars inhabiting 44 districts and ten counties in Lithuania were analysed using conventional nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time Taqman RT-PCR for the detection of PRRSV-specific open reading frame (ORF) 1 and 6 sequences. PRRSV was highly prevalent in Lithuanian wild boar populations, with an average rate of 18.66Â % using conventional RT-PCR and 19.54Â % using real-time RT-PCR. PRRSV was detected in 36.71 and 41.77Â % of 237 hunting grounds tested by conventional RT-nPCR and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. No statistically significant differences in PRRSV prevalence were observed by geographic area in the ten Lithuanian counties. Animals infected with PRRSV were identified in all age groups; however, significantly higher prevalence rates were identified in subadult and adult wild boars than in juveniles up to 12Â months old. No positive results were obtained using conventional PCR with Type 2 specific primers. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial ORF5 region revealed that ten wild boars harboured virus sequences belonging to genetic subtypes 3 and 4 and may therefore pose a serious threat to Lithuanian pig farms in which only subtype two strains are circulating. The results of virus prevalence and phylogenetic analyses strongly support the role of wild boars as a possible natural reservoir for PRRSV in Lithuania."

In particular, viruses of the subtypes H1 and H3 were transmitted between pigs and poultry, predominantly turkeys, in regions with a high population density of both species. The recovery of a swine influenza H1N1 virus from a turkey flock in Germany in 2009 prompted us to investigate molecularly the subtype H1 viruses recently detected in wild birds, pigs and poultry. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between H1N1 viruses originating from wild and domestic animals of Germany and to identify potential trans-species transmission or reassortment events. Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene or full-length genome sequences were generated from selected, current H1N1 viruses from wild birds, pigs and turkeys. Phylogenetic analyses were combined with genotyping and analyses of the deduced amino acid sequences with respect to biologically active sites. Antigenic relationships were assessed by hemagglutination inhibition reactions. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin sequences showed that viruses from distinct H1 subgroups co-circulate among domestic animals and wild birds. In addition, these viruses comprised different genotypes and were distinguishable antigenically. An H1N1 virus isolated from a turkey farm in northern Germany in 2009 showed the highest similarity with the avian-like porcine H1N1 influenza viruses circulating in Europe since the late 1970s. The data demonstrate the genetic and antigenic heterogeneity of H1 viruses currently circulating in domestic and wild animals in Germany and points to turkeys as a possible bridge between avian and mammalian hosts."

CRESS DNA viruses are present in the virome of many ecosystems and are known to infect a wide range of organisms. A large number of the recently identified CRESS DNA viruses cannot be classified into any known viral families, indicating that the current view of CRESS DNA viral sequence space is greatly underestimated. Animal faecal matter has proven to be a particularly useful source for sampling CRESS DNA viruses in an ecosystem, as it is cost-effective and non-invasive. In this study a viral metagenomic approach was used to explore the diversity of CRESS DNA viruses present in the faeces of domesticated and wild animals in New Zealand. Thirty-eight complete CRESS DNA viral genomes and two circular molecules (that may be defective molecules or single components of multicomponent genomes) were identified from forty-nine individual animal faecal samples. Based on shared genome organisations and sequence similarities, eighteen of the isolates were classified as gemycircularviruses and twelve isolates were classified as smacoviruses. The remaining eight isolates lack significant sequence similarity with any members of known CRESS DNA virus groups. This research adds significantly to our knowledge of CRESS DNA viral diversity in New Zealand, emphasising the prevalence of CRESS DNA viruses in nature, and reinforcing the suggestion that a large proportion of CRESS DNA viruses are yet to be identified."

Total genomic DNA was extracted from the samples and subjected to PCR with degenerate papillomavirus (PV)-specific primers. Similarity searches performed with blastn showed that partial E1 and L1 sequences of two novel PVs were amplified. Subsequently, the complete genomes of these Sus scrofa papillomaviruses (SsPVs) were amplified by long-template PCR, cloned and sequenced using a transposon insertion method. They contained the typical PV open reading frames (ORFs) E1, E2, E4, E6, L1 and L2, but the E7 ORF was absent in both viruses. Pairwise nucleotide sequence alignment of the L1 ORFs of the SsPVs showed 98.5 % similarity, classifying these viruses as SsPV type 1 'variants' (SsPV-1a and -1b). Based on a concatenated alignment of the E1, E2, L1 and L2 ORFs of SsPV-1 variants a and b, and 81 other human and animal PV type species, a neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed. This phylogenetic analysis showed that the SsPV-1a and -1b variants did not cluster with the other PVs of artiodactyls (cloven-hoofed) host species, but clustered on the edge of the genus Alphapapillomavirus, very near to the root of this genus."

Marek's disease virus 1 (MDV-1) is an avian herpesvirus that naturally infects chicken and induces T cells lymphomas. During latency, MDV-1, like other herpesviruses, expresses a limited subset of transcripts. These include three miRNA clusters. Several studies identified the expression of virus and host encoded miRNAs from MDV-1 infected cell cultures and chickens. But a high discrepancy was observed when miRNA cloning frequencies obtained from different cloning and sequencing protocols were compared. Thus, we analyzed the effect of small RNA library preparation and sequencing on the miRNA frequencies obtained from the same RNA samples collected during MDV-1 infection of chicken at different steps of the oncoviral pathogenesis. Qualitative and quantitative variations were found in the data, depending on the strategy used. One of the mature miRNA derived from the latency-associated-transcript (LAT), mdv1-miR-M7-5p, showed the highest variation. Its cloning frequency was 50% of the viral miRNA counts when a small scale sequencing approach was used. Its frequency was 100 times less abundant when determined through the deep sequencing approach. Northern blot analysis showed a better correlation with the miRNA frequencies found by the small scale sequencing approach. By analyzing the cellular miRNA repertoire, we also found a gap between the two sequencing approaches. Collectively, our study indicates that next-generation sequencing data considered alone are limited for assessing the absolute copy number of transcripts. Thus, the quantification of small RNA should be addressed by compiling data obtained by using different techniques such as microarrays, qRT-PCR and NB analysis in support of high throughput sequencing data. These observations should be considered when miRNA variations are studied prior addressing functional studies."

Whole genome sequencing was used to compare E. coli O157 isolates from host reservoirs (cattle and sheep) from Scotland and to compare genetic variation of isolates (human, animal, environmental/food) obtained from Scotland, New Zealand, Netherlands, Canada and the USA. Nei's genetic distance calculated from core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) demonstrated that the animal isolates were from the same population. Investigation of the Shiga toxin bacteriophage and their insertion sites (SBI typing) revealed that cattle and sheep isolates had statistically indistinguishable rarefaction profiles, diversity and genotypes. In contrast, isolates from different countries exhibited significant differences in Nei's genetic distance and SBI typing. Hence, after successful international transmission, which has occurred on multiple occasions, local genetic variation occurs, resulting in a global patchwork of continental and trans-continental phylogeographic clades. These findings are important for three reasons: first, understanding transmission and evolution of infectious diseases associated with multiple host reservoirs and multi-geographic locations; second, highlighting the relevance of the sheep reservoir when considering farm based interventions; and third, improving our understanding of why human disease incidence varies across the world."

These genotypes are divided into subtypes based on phylogenetic analysis, namely a-p for BVDV-1 and a-c for BVDV-2. Within this study, the genetic heterogeneity of BVDV-1 in England and Wales was investigated and compared to the situation in 1996/1997. Viral RNA was extracted from 316 blood samples collected between 2004 and 2009 that were previously identified as BVDV-1 positive. A region of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) was amplified by RT-PCR and the PCR products were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5'UTR demonstrated the existence of five subtypes of BVDV-1 circulating in England and Wales, namely BVDV-1a (244 samples), BVDV-1b (50), BVDV-1e (3), BVDV-1f (1) and BVDV-1i (18). Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence for the N(pro) region of the viral genome supported the classification obtained with the 5'UTR. Given the fact that only three subtypes were detected in 1999 this report supports the notion that the restocking of cattle from continental Europe, after the mass culling during the Foot-and-Mouth outbreak in 2001 and slaughter of cattle due to bovine tuberculosis infection, has increased the genetic diversity of BVDV-1 subtypes in England and Wales in the past 10 years."

The H7N2 viruses were phylogenetically closely related to each other and to viruses isolated in Hong Kong in the 1970s. We determined the pathogenicity of the H7N2 viruses by infecting chickens and mice. Our results suggest that pikas might play an important role in the ecology of AIVs, acting as intermediate hosts in which viruses become more adapted to mammals.

The aim of this study is to investigate the roles of the Rybp gene on bovine skeletal muscle development and myoblast differentiation. In the present study, the Rybp gene was overexpressed in bovine myoblasts via adenovirus. RNA-seq was performed to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The results showed that overexpressing the Rybp gene inhibits the formation of myotubes. The morphological differences in myoblasts began on the second day and were very significant 6 days after adenovirus induction. A total of 1311 (707 upregulated and 604 downregulated) DEGs were screened using RNA-seq between myoblasts with added negative control adenoviruses (AD-NC) and Rybp adenoviruses (AD-Rybp) after 6 days of induction. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis revealed that the downregulated DEGs were mainly involved in biological functions related to muscle, and, of the 32 pathways, those associated with muscle development were significantly enriched for the identified DEGs. This study can not only provide a theoretical basis for the regulation of skeletal muscle development in cattle by exploring the roles of the Rybp gene in myoblast differentiation, but it can also lay a theoretical foundation for molecular breeding of beef cattle.</jats:p>"

The AAVs are generally considered non-pathogenic, and they have the ability to attenuate the replication of other more pathogenic viruses, which makes them attractive as potential therapeutics or preventative measures. This study characterized a novel AAV isolated from Muscovy ducks in China. The novel virus (MHH-05-2015) was isolated after propagating a field isolate of the DAdV-3 virus (a type 3 duck adenovirus) in duck embryo fibroblasts. The full genome sequence of MHH-05-2015 was determined, and the nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared to other avian AAVs. The genomic distribution of the structural and non-structural protein-coding genes in MHH-05-2015 was conserved and consistent with the other AAVs. Compared to previously isolated avian AAVs, MHH-05-2015 had approximately 63 to 64% sequence identity. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that MHH-05-2015 clustered separately from other avian AAVs, suggesting that MHH-05-2015 was not directly descended from other Dependoparvovirus family members. These results suggest that MHH-05-2015 is a new subtype of AAV that is distinct from other avian AAVs."

However, a comparable classification of NLVs in other species remains to be carried out. We sequenced a 2-kb region from within the RNA polymerase gene to the 3' end of open reading frame 2 (ORF2) of two NLV strains previously detected in the caecum contents of healthy pigs. The sequences of the entire ORF2 of these two NLV strains were analyzed for their genetic relationships to 15 human strains, which have already been reported and used as references for the genetic classification of human NLV strains, and additional two strains; one, a human strain which has recently been reported and appears to represent a new genetic subgroup of GII; and the other, an animal NLV strain. Analysis of a matrix showing pairwise identities and topology of a neighbor-joining tree showed that the two swine strains could be classified into a new genetic subgroup of GII on the basis of the amino acid sequences of the entire capsid protein. Grouping of the two swine strains was well corroborated by results of similar analyses of nucleotide sequences of the entire ORF2 and of a 510 base region at the 3' end of ORF1."

By this method, virus-infected cells are bound and fixed in a single step, and the viral RNA in the fixed-cell preparation is characterized directly by its ability to hybridize to cDNA probes specific for either the A or B subgroups of RS virus. The subgroup-specific probes were constructed from cDNA clones that corresponded to a portion of the extracellular domain of the RS virus G protein of either a subgroup B RS virus (8/60) or a subgroup A RS virus (A2). The cDNA probes were labeled with 32P and used to analyze RS virus isolates collected over a period of three decades. Replicate templates of infected cell preparations were hybridized with either the subgroup A or B probe. The subgroup assignments of 40 viruses tested by nucleic acid hybridization were in agreement with the results of subgroup determinations based on their reactivities with monoclonal antibodies, which previously has been the only method available for determining the subgroup classification of RS virus isolates. The nucleic acid hybridization assay has the advantage of providing broad-based discrimination of the two subgroups on the basis of nucleic acid homology, irrespective of minor antigenic differences that are detected in assays in which monoclonal antibodies are used. The nucleic acid hybridization technique provides a reliable method for RS virus subgroup characterization.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study was to investigate PBV infection and its association with diarrhea. Here, seven PBV RT-PCR-positive fecal samples from diarrheic children and four fecal samples from healthy children as controls were analyzed by viral metagenomics. The results indicated that all the seven diarrheic fecal samples contain high titers of PBV sequences, while three of the controls were negative, and one had low titers of PBV. Three of the diarrheic fecal samples were also positive for other viruses, including anellovirus, human gyrovirus, human parechovirus, and porcine stool-associated circular virus. PBV sequences from the seven patients were assembled, generating seven large contigs with the complete ORF of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of RdRp indicated that the seven PBVs in the present study belonged to three different genogroups.

To understand the epidemiological characteristics of the pseudorabies virus (PRV) strains currently prevalent in China, a total of 16,256 samples collected from pig farms suspected of PRV infection in 27 Provinces of China between 2012 and 2017 were evaluated for detection of PRV. Since the extensive use of gE-deleted PRV vaccine in China, the PRV-gE was applied for determining wild-type virus infection by PCR. Of the 16,256 samples detected, approximately 1,345 samples were positive for the detection of PRV-gE, yielding an average positive rate of 8.27%. The positive rates of PRV detection from 2012 to 2017 were 11.92% (153/1284), 12.19% (225/1846), 6.70% (169/2523), 11.10% (269/2424), 5.57% (147/2640), and 6.90% (382/5539), respectively. To understand the genetic characteristics of the PRV strains currently circulating, 25 PRV strains isolated from those PRV-gE positive samples were selected for further investigation. Phylogenetic analysis based on gB, gC, and gE showed that PRV strains prevalent in China had a remarkably distinct evolutionary relationship with PRVs from other countries, which might explain the observation that Bartha-K61 vaccine was unable to provide full protection against emergent strains. Sequence alignments identified many amino acid changes within the gB, gC, and gE proteins of the PRVs circulating in China after the outbreak compared to those from other countries or those prevalent in China before the outbreak; those changes also might affect the protective efficacy of previously used vaccines in China, as well as being associated in part with the increased virulence of the current PRV epidemic strains in China."

In this study, for the first time, we report the isolation and genetic analyses of three novel triple-reassortant H1N1 swine influenza viruses from pigs in Tianjin, Northern China. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these novel viruses contained genes from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (PB2, PB1, PA and NP), Eurasian swine (HA, NA and M) and triple-reassortant swine (NS) lineages. This indicated that the reassortment among the 2009 pandemic H1N1, Eurasian swine and triple-reassortant swine influenza viruses had taken place in pigs in Tianjin and resulted in the generation of new viruses. Furthermore, three human-like H1N1, two classical swine H1N1 and two Eurasian swine H1N1 viruses were also isolated during the swine influenza virus surveillance from 2009 to 2013, which indicated that multiple genetic lineages of swine H1N1 viruses were co-circulating in the swine population in Tianjin, China. The emergence of novel triple-reassortant H1N1 swine influenza viruses may be a potential threat to human health and emphasizes the importance of further continuous surveillance."

The characteristics of three virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates from this outbreak (NDV-Belize-3/08, NDV-Belize-4/08, and NDV-Belize-12/08) were assessed by genomic analysis and by clinicopathological characterization in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. The results showed that all three strains belong to NDV genotype V and are virulent, as assessed by the intracerebral pathogenicity index and the polybasic amino acid sequence at the fusion protein cleavage site. In 4-week-old SPF chickens, NDV-Belize-3/08 behaved as a typical velogenic viscerotropic NDV strain, causing severe necrohemorrhagic lesions in the lymphoid organs, with systemic virus distribution. Phylogenetic analysis of multiple NDV genotype V representatives revealed that genotype V can be divided into three subgenotypes, namely, Va, Vb, and Vc, and that all tested Belizean isolates belong to subgenotype Vb. Furthermore, these isolates are nearly identical to a 2007 isolate from Honduras and appear to have evolved separately from other contemporary viruses circulating in Mexico, clustering into a new clade within NDV subgenotype Vb."

To date, HEV has been isolated from many animal species. The family Hepeviridae consists of two genera. The genus Orthohepevirus includes four distinct species (A, B, C, and D), each with distinct genotypes. Within the Orthohepevirus A species, HEV-1 and HEV-2 host ranges are restricted to humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 primarily infect a wide range of diverse animal species, in addition to being zoonotic to humans. Swine and wild boar species were previously thought to be the primary natural HEV reservoir, but recently rabbits have also been identified as major carriers. Moreover, increasing the number of HEV infections within the food supply chain underscore the important role of farming and food processing practices in limiting virus transmission. Notably, a Chinese commercial vaccine has the potential to protect humans and possibly animal reservoirs from HEV infection. This review summarizes the status of HEV infection worldwide in different animal species and outlines various modes of zoonotic transmission, with reference to cross-species transmission and recent vaccine developments."

These viral pathogens cause epithelial lesions, and then infect the nervous system to cause lifelong latency, reactivation, and spread. A related veterinary herpesvirus, pseudorabies (PRV), causes similar disease in livestock that result in significant economic losses. Vaccines developed for VZV and PRV serve as useful models for the development of an HSV-1 vaccine. We present full genome sequence comparisons of the PRV vaccine strain Bartha, and two virulent PRV isolates, Kaplan and Becker. These genome sequences were determined by high-throughput sequencing and assembly, and present new insights into the attenuation of a mammalian alphaherpesvirus vaccine strain. We find many previously unknown coding differences between PRV Bartha and the virulent strains, including changes to the fusion proteins gH and gB, and over forty other viral proteins. Inter-strain variation in PRV protein sequences is much closer to levels previously observed for HSV-1 than for the highly stable VZV proteome. Almost 20% of the PRV genome contains tandem short sequence repeats (SSRs), a class of nucleic acids motifs whose length-variation has been associated with changes in DNA binding site efficiency, transcriptional regulation, and protein interactions. We find SSRs throughout the herpesvirus family, and provide the first global characterization of SSRs in viruses, both within and between strains. We find SSR length variation between different isolates of PRV and HSV-1, which may provide a new mechanism for phenotypic variation between strains. Finally, we detected a small number of polymorphic bases within each plaque-purified PRV strain, and we characterize the effect of passage and plaque-purification on these polymorphisms. These data add to growing evidence that even plaque-purified stocks of stable DNA viruses exhibit limited sequence heterogeneity, which likely seeds future strain evolution."

Selective reduction of virus titer by either antiserum could determine the type of HSV. No equivocal intermediate case was found among a number of stock strains including many fresh isolates.

Phylogenetic trees confirmed that wbJNN_13 is distantly related to all known HEV isolates. A Simplot analysis revealed no significant recombination among the existing HEV strains.

Whole-genome sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolates represented 15 genotypes, according to the genetic constellation of the eight segments. All of the H1N1 viruses were entirely A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, whereas all of the H1N2 and H3N2 viruses were reassortants among 5 distinct ancestral viruses: H1 and H3 triple-reassortant (TR) IAV-S that originated from North American pre-2009 human seasonal H1, human seasonal H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Notably, 93% of the reassortant IAV-S retained M genes that were derived from A(H1N1)pdm09, suggesting some advantage in terms of their host adaptation. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis revealed that multiple introductions of A(H1N1)pdm09 and TR IAV-S into the Vietnamese pig population have driven the genetic diversity of currently circulating Vietnamese IAV-S. In addition, our results indicate that a reassortant IAV-S with human-like H3 and N2 genes and an A(H1N1)pdm09 origin M gene likely caused a human case in Ho Chi Minh City in 2010. Our current findings indicate that human-to-pig transmission as well as cocirculation of different IAV-S have contributed to diversifying the gene constellations of IAV-S in Vietnam. This comprehensive genetic characterization of 388 influenza A viruses of swine (IAV-S) isolated through active surveillance of Vietnamese pig farms from 2010 through 2015 provides molecular epidemiological insight into the genetic diversification of IAV-S in Vietnam after the emergence of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Multiple reassortments among A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses and enzootic IAV-S yielded 14 genotypes, 9 of which carried novel gene combinations. The reassortants that carried M genes derived from A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses became predominant, replacing those of the IAV-S that had been endemic in Vietnam since 2011. Notably, one of the novel reassortants likely caused a human case in Vietnam. Given that Vietnam is the second-largest pig-producing country in Asia, continued monitoring of IAV-S is highly important from the viewpoints of both the swine industry and human public health."

EV-A71 outbreaks have been associated with (sub)genogroup switches, sometimes accompanied by recombination events. Understanding EV-A71 population dynamics is therefore essential for understanding this emerging infection, and may provide pivotal information for vaccine development. Despite the public health burden of EV-A71, relatively few EV-A71 complete-genome sequences are available for analysis and from limited geographical localities. The availability of an efficient procedure for whole-genome sequencing would stimulate effort to generate more viral sequence data. Herein, we report for the first time the development of a next-generation sequencing based protocol for whole-genome sequencing of EV-A71 directly from clinical specimens. We were able to sequence viruses of subgenogroup C4 and B5, while RNA from culture materials of diverse EV-A71 subgenogroups belonging to both genogroup B and C was successfully amplified. The nature of intra-host genetic diversity was explored in 22 clinical samples, revealing 107 positions carrying minor variants (ranging from 0 to 15 variants per sample). Our analysis of EV-A71 strains sampled in 2013 showed that they all belonged to subgenogroup B5, representing the first report of this subgenogroup in Vietnam. In conclusion, we have successfully developed a high-throughput next-generation sequencing-based assay for whole-genome sequencing of EV-A71 from clinical samples."

No effective vaccine or treatment has been developed for SARS-coronavirus or FIP virus, both of which cause lethal diseases. It has been reported that a cyclophilin inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA), could inhibit the replication of coronaviruses. CsA is a well-known immunosuppressive drug that binds to cellular cyclophilins to inhibit calcineurin, a calcium-calmodulin-activated serine/threonine-specific phosphatase. The inhibition of calcineurin blocks the translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells from the cytosol into the nucleus, thus preventing the transcription of genes encoding cytokines such as interleukin-2. Cyclophilins are peptidyl-prolyl isomerases with physiological functions that have been described for many years to include chaperone and foldase activities. Also, many viruses require cyclophilins for replication; these include human immunodeficiency virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and hepatitis C virus. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the suppression of viral replication differ for different viruses. This review describes the suppressive effects of CsA on coronavirus replication."

In addition, new viruses continue to challenge the human population owing to the encroachment of human settlements into animal and livestock habitats, globalization, climate change, growing numbers of immunocompromised people and bioterrorism. Metagenomics-based tools, such as microarrays and high-throughput sequencing are ideal for responding to these challenges. Pan-viral microarrays, containing representative sequences from all known viruses, have been used to detect novel and distantly-related variants of known viruses.

Based on nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences, the genetic variation was examined, phylogeny was estimated and selection pressures were also analyzed. This study demonstrated that the major genotype (G) of JEV isolates had shifted from GIII to GI in the mid-1990s in Oita. The intensities of selection acting on the Oita GIII and GI strains were found to be almost same. It suggests that the intensity of selection might not be the reason for such a genotype shift observed in Oita. Pairwise comparisons revealed the high conservation of the E gene at the protein level. Compared with the Oita GIII strains, all the Oita GI strains shared four amino acid changes at E129 (T-M), E222 (A-S), E327 (S-T) and E366 (A-S). Among all 70 JEV isolates involved in this paper, the GI strains shared only one amino acid change at E222 (A-S) in comparison with the GIII strains. No strong evidence for positive selection was found, the JEV evolution has generally been subject to strong purifying selection, but one ongoing evolutionary pathway was found to be under relaxed purifying selection in Oita. This study is a localized example of JEV molecular evolution in nature."

            Bacteriophages play an important role in bacterial evolution through lysogeny, where the phage genome is integrated into the host chromosome. While phage integration generally occurs at a specific site in the host chromosome, it is also known to occur at other, so-called secondary sites. In this study, we developed a new experimental technology to comprehensively study secondary integration sites and discovered that phage can integrate into over 300 unique sites in the host genome, resulting in significant genetic diversity in bacteria. We further developed an assay to examine the phenotypic consequence of such diverse integration events and found that phage integration can cause changes in evolutionarily relevant traits such as bacterial motility and increases in antibiotic resistance. Importantly, our method is readily applicable to other phage-bacterium systems.

Persistent infection correlates with accelerated decline in lung function and early mortality. The horizontal transfer of DNA by temperate bacteriophages can add gene function and selective advantages to their bacterial host within the constrained environment of the lower lung. In this study, we chemically induce temperate bacteriophages from clonal cultures of Pa and identify their mixed viral communities employing metagenomic approaches. We compared 92 temperate phage metagenomes stratified from these clinical backgrounds (47 CF and 45 nCFBR Pa isolates) using MG-RAST and GeneWise2. KEGG analysis shows the complexity of temperate phage accessory gene carriage increases with duration and severity of the disease. Furthermore, we identify the presence of Ig-like motifs within phage structural genes linked to bacterial adhesion and carbohydrate binding including Big_2, He_Pig, and Fn3. This study provides the first clinical support to the proposed bacteriophage adherence to mucus (BAM) model and the evolution of phages interacting at these mucosal surfaces over time."

Detailed demographic, travel, clinical, and lifestyle questionnaires were undertaken. The majority of viremic individuals (57/79) were seronegative at time of donation but all seroconverted. Viremia was short-lived, with a median of 6.5 weeks to confirmed viral clearance. All infections were acquired in the United Kingdom and were G3, with Group 2 viruses predominating (43/54; 80%). Infection was associated with some clinical symptoms both at and after donation (8/77; 10%). Viral loads and symptoms were more pronounced in Group 1 infections. There was no serologic evidence of reinfection. Donors were more commonly male (pâ=â0.002); both male and female donors were older than comparator donors. Animal contact was unlikely to be the source of infection. Consumption of chicken and pig meat was common to all infected donors; processed pig meat was most commonly purchased from one particular retail chain. Viremic donors represent primary infection in older members of the community and reflect a widespread zoonotic in the United Kingdom.

Several zoonotic viruses are transmitted to humans directly via contact with an animal or indirectly via exposure to the urine or feces of infected animals or the bite of a bloodsucking arthropod. If a virus is able to adapt and replicate in its new human host, human-to-human transmissions may occur, possibly resulting in an epidemic, such as the A/H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009. Thus, predicting emerging zoonotic infections is an important challenge for public health officials in the coming decades. The recent development of viral metagenomics, i.e., the characterization of the complete viral diversity isolated from an organism or an environment using high-throughput sequencing technologies, is promising for the surveillance of such diseases and can be accomplished by analyzing the viromes of selected animals and arthropods that are closely in contact with humans. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of viral diversity within such animals (in particular blood-feeding arthropods, wildlife and domestic animals) using metagenomics and present its possible future application for the surveillance of zoonotic and arboviral diseases."

As part of a global metagenomic analysis of viral communities existing in biting midges, we report here for the first time the identification and isolation of a Faustovirus-like virus in hematophagous arthropods and its detection in their animal hosts. The DNA virome analysis of three pools of Culicoides sp., engorged female Culicoides imicola and non-engorged male/female C. imicola biting midges collected in Senegal, revealed the presence of amoeba-infecting giant viruses and, among them, a majority of sequences related to Faustovirus. Phylogenetic analyses conducted on several structural genes of Faustovirus confirmed the clustering of the arthropod-borne Faustovirus with sewage-borne Faustoviruses, with a distinct geographical clustering of Senegalese Faustovirus strains. Transmission electron microscopy identified viral particles with morphologies and diameters which were compatible with Faustovirus. The presence of infectious arthropod-borne Faustovirus was finally confirmed by successful isolation on V. vermiformis amoeba. Global proteomic analysis of biting midges identified that arthropods' blood meal originating from cattle, rodents and humans. Further screening of cattle sera and rodent tissue resulted in prevalence of Faustovirus being estimated at 38% in rodents and 14% in cattle, suggesting a possible origin of Faustovirus presence in arthropods via the ingestion of contaminated blood meal. Viral loads were the highest in rodents' urine and kidney samples, suggesting a possible excretion of viral particles into the environment. Faustovirus DNA polymerase-related sequences were also detected in more than 9 and 11% of febrile patients and healthy Senegalese human sera, respectively. Our study thus, highlights the need to investigate the role of arthropods, wildlife, and domestic animals in the lifecycle of amoeba-infecting giant viruses and, in particular, the environmental cycle of Faustovirus."

In the present study, the fecal virome of a non-diarrheic Belgian piglet was determined. Although the virome of only a single piglet was analyzed, some interesting data were obtained, including the second complete genome of a pig group C rotavirus (RVC). This Belgian strain was only distantly related to the only other completely characterized pig RVC strain, Cowden. Its relatedness to RVC strains from other host species was also analyzed and the porcine strain found in our study was only distantly related to RVCs detected in humans and cows. The gene encoding the outer capsid protein VP7 belonged to the rare porcine G3 genotype, which might be serologically distinct from most other pig RVC strains. A putative novel RVC VP6 genotype was identified as well. A group A rotavirus strain also present in this fecal sample contained the rare pig genotype combination G11P[27], but was only partially characterized. Typical pig RVA genotypes I5, A8, and T7 were found for the viral proteins VP6, NSP1, and NSP3, respectively. Interestingly, the fecal virome of the piglet also contained an astrovirus and an enterovirus, of which the complete genomes were characterized. Results of the current study indicate that many viruses may be present simultaneously in fecal samples of non-diarrheic piglets. In this study, these viruses could not be directly associated with any disease, but still they might have had a potential subclinical impact on pig growth performance. The fast evolution of NGS will be a powerful tool for future diagnostics in veterinary practice. Its application will certainly lead to better insights into the relevance of many (sub)clinical enteric viral infections, that may have remained unnoticed using traditional diagnostic techniques. This will stimulate the development of new and durable prophylactic measures to improve pig health and production."

The aims of this study were to obtain prevalence data on HEV infection in swine in Belgium and to phylogenetically compare Belgian human HEV sequences with those obtained from swine. An ELISA screening prevalence of 73% (95% CI 68.8-77.5) was determined in Belgian pigs and a part of the results were re-evaluated by Western blot (WB). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed and scenarios varying the ELISA specificity relative to WB were analysed. The seroprevalences estimated by the different scenarios ranged between 69 and 81% and are in agreement with the high exposure of the European pig population to HEV. Pig HEV sequences were genetically compared to those detected in humans in Belgium and a predominance of genotype 3 subtype f was shown in both swine and humans. The high HEV seroprevalence in swine and the close phylogenetic relationships between pig and human HEV sequences further support the risk for zoonotic transmission of HEV between humans and pigs."

The overall arrangement of genes has been obtained by the analysis of homologies between short BHV-4 DNA sequences and corresponding genes of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and herpesvirus saimiri (HVS). The gene expression is temporally regulated. Glycoprotein precursor p (gp10/gp17) is expressed as gamma 1 polypeptide. Glycoproteins gp1, gp8, gp11 and their precursors are gamma 2 proteins. The analysis of strain variations allows the definition of two types of strains, based on the DNA patterns: the Movar 33/63-like and the DN 599-like strains. Only the M40 strain, isolated in India, fails to fit this classification. The genomic variations have been compiled to build a dendrogram showing three levels of divergence between BHV-4 strains or isolates. The available molecular data indicate that the BHV-4 genome shares much similarity with the DNA of EBV and HVS, two representative members of the gammaherpesvirinae.

          <jats:p>The distribution and prevalence of H3 subtype influenza viruses in avian and mammalian hosts constitutes a potential threat to both human and avian health. We report a complete genome sequence of a novel reassortant H3N2 avian influenza virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that HA and NA showed the highest sequence homologies with those of A/white-backed munia/Hong Kong/4519/2009 (H3N2). However, the internal genes had the highest sequence homologies with those of H6 and H7 subtypes. The data provide further evidence of the existence of a natural reassortant H3N2 strain in southern China.</jats:p>"

The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of these E2s had only a 60-65% homology with group I BVDV E2s but >90% homology with the E2 of a subgroup of sheep border disease viruses. The E2 gene of the NADL strain was expressed and monospecific antibodies were raised in calves and rabbits.

Sequence comparison showed that the exotic viruses shared 99.0-99.4% nucleotide identities (99.4-100.0% amino acid identities) with Chinese viruses and, on the contrary, 96.2-97.2% nucleotide identities (97.8-98.6% amino acid identities) with indigenous Taiwanese viruses. Additionally, our phylogenetic analysis also supported that the newly invaded bovine ephemeral fever viruses were closely related to the Chinese strains. These exotic 2013-2014 viruses have become prevalent and displaced indigenous virus strains since their appearance."

We have exploited bioinformatics and experimental approaches to establish that the effector repertoire in the Sakai strain of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is much larger than previously thought. Homology searches led to the identification of >60 putative effector genes. Thirteen of these were judged to be likely pseudogenes, whereas 49 were judged to be potentially functional. In total, 39 proteins were confirmed experimentally as effectors: 31 through proteomics and 28 through translocation assays. At the protein level, the EHEC effector sequences fall into >20 families. The largest family, the NleG family, contains 14 members in the Sakai strain alone. EHEC also harbors functional homologs of effectors from plant pathogens (HopPtoH, HopW, AvrA) and from Shigella (OspD, OspE, OspG), and two additional members of the Map/IpgB family. Genes encoding proven or predicted effectors occur in >20 exchangeable effector loci scattered throughout the chromosome. Crucially, the majority of functional effector genes are encoded by nine exchangeable effector loci that lie within lambdoid prophages. Thus, type III secretion in E. coli is linked to a vast phage ""metagenome,"" acting as a crucible for the evolution of pathogenicity."

The complete genome consists of only 20,261 nt and represents the smallest reported coronavirus genome. We identified seven ORFs, including the canonical nidovirus ORF1a and ORF1b. Analysis of polyprotein 1ab revealed that this virus, tentatively named bovine nidovirus (BoNV), shares the highest homology with the recently described python-borne nidoviruses and contains several conserved nidovirus motifs, but does not encode the NendoU or O-MT domains that are present in other viruses within the family Coronaviridae. In concert with its reduced genome, the atypical domain architecture indicates that this virus represents a unique lineage within the order Nidovirales."

            Ticks are implicated as vectors of a wide array of human and animal pathogens. To better understand the extent of tick-borne diseases, it is crucial to uncover the full range of microbial agents associated with ticks. Our current knowledge of the diversity of tick-associated viruses is limited, in part due to the lack of investigation of tick viromes. In this study, we examined the viromes of three tick species from the United States. We found that ticks are hosts to highly divergent viruses across several taxa, including ones previously associated with human disease. Our data underscore the diversity of tick-associated viruses and provide the foundation for further studies into viral etiology of tick-borne diseases.

Here, we present an IAV surveillance study conducted in western Portugal 2008-2009, analyzing 1653 samples from six different species of waterfowl, with the majority of samples taken from Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Overall 4.4% of sampled birds were infected. The sampling results revealed a significant temporal variation in the IAV prevalence, including a pronounced peak among predominantly young birds in June, indicating that IAV circulate within breeding populations in the wetlands of western Portugal. The H10N7 and H9N2 subtypes were predominant among isolated viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences of H10N7, H9N2 and H11N3 virus showed that sequences from Portugal were closely related to viral sequences from Central Europe as well as to IAVs isolated in the southern parts of Africa, reflecting Portugal's position on the European-African bird migratory flyway. This study highlights the importance of Portugal as a migratory crossroad for IAV, connecting breeding stationary waterfowl with birds migrating between continents which enable transmission and spread of IAV."

IBDV (Avibirnavirus, Birnaviridae) is a non-enveloped virus with a bisegmented double-stranded RNA genome. The virus is traditionally classified into classic, variant and very virulent strains, each with different epidemiological relevance and clinical implications. Recently, a novel worldwide spread genetic lineage was described and denoted as distinct (d) IBDV. Here, we report the development and validation of a reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay for the specific detection of dIBDVs in the global poultry industry. The assay employs a TaqMan-MGB probe that hybridizes with a unique molecular signature of dIBDV. The assay successfully detected all the assessed strains belonging to the dIBDV genetic lineage, showing high specificity and absence of cross-reactivity with non-dIBDVs, IBDV-negative samples and other common avian viruses. Using serial dilutions of in vitro-transcribed RNA we obtained acceptable PCR efficiencies and determination coefficients, and relatively small intra- and inter-assay variability.

Histopathologic features of the lesions were consistent with this diagnosis. Orf virus DNA, phylogenetically similar to an isolate from a captive muskox of the Minnesota Zoo, US, was detected in the lesions by PCR using Parapoxvirus primers. Additionally, there was a metaphyseal abscess with a cortical fistula in the right metacarpus from which Brucella suis biovar 4 was isolated and identification supported by PCR. Brucella spp. antibodies were detected in serum. Finally, 212 nodules were dissected from the lungs. Fecal analysis and lung examination demonstrated co-infection with the lungworms Umingmakstrongylus pallikuukensis and Varestrongylus eleguneniensis. The zoonotic potential of orf and rangiferine brucellosis adds an important public health dimension to this case, particularly given that muskoxen are a valuable source of food for Arctic residents. Careful examination of these pathogens at a population level is needed as they may contribute to muskox population decline and potentially constitute a driver of food insecurity for local communities. This case underscores the importance of wildlife health surveillance as a management tool to conserve wildlife populations and maintain food security in subsistence-oriented communities."

We cloned a virus isolate from a parrot that had characteristic lesions of PD. Three viral clones were partially sequenced, demonstrating that this virus was an alphaherpesvirus most closely related to the gallid herpesvirus 1. Five primer sets were developed from these sequences. The primer sets were used with PCR to screen tissues or tissue culture media suspected to contain viruses from 54 outbreaks of PD. The primer sets amplified DNA from all but one sample. Ten amplification patterns were detected, indicating that PD is caused by a genetically heterogeneous population of viruses. A single genetic variant (psittacid herpesvirus variant 1) amplified with all primer sets and was the most common virus variant (62.7%). A single primer set (23F) amplified DNA from all of the positive samples, suggesting that PCR could be used as a rapid postmortem assay for these viruses. PCR was found to be significantly more sensitive than tissue culture for the detection of psittacid herpesviruses."

All viruses caused Pacheco's disease, and serotypes of the European isolates were known. A phylogenetic tree derived from these sequences demonstrated that the PsHVs that cause Pacheco's disease comprised four major genotypes, with each genotype including between two and four variants. With the exception of two viruses, the serotypes of the virus isolates could be predicted by the genotypes. Genotypes 1 and 4 corresponded to serotype 1 isolates, genotype 2 corresponded to serotype 2 isolates, and genotype 3 corresponded to serotype 3 isolates. The single serotype 4 virus mapped to genotype 4. DNA from a virus with a unique serotype could not be amplified with primers that amplified DNA from all other PsHVs, and its classification remains unknown. Viruses representing all four genotypes were found in both the United States and Europe, and it was therefore predicted that serotypes 1, 2, and 3 were present in the United States. Serotype 4 was represented by a single European isolate that could not be genetically distinguished from serotype 1 viruses; therefore, the presence of serotype 4 in the United States could not be predicted. Viruses of genotype 4 were found to be the most commonly associated with Pacheco's disease in macaws and conures and were least likely to be isolated in chicken embryo fibroblasts in the United States. All four genotypes caused deaths in Amazon parrots, but genotype 4 was associated with Pacheco's disease only in Amazons in Europe. Genotypes 2, 3, and 4, but not 1, were found in African grey parrots. Although parrots from the Pacific distribution represent a relatively small percentage of the total number of birds with Pacheco's disease, all four genotypes were found to cause disease in these species."

Other approaches, including microarray, real-time RT-PCR and Illumina sequencing are capable of detecting only the aggregate transcriptional activity of particular genomic regions, but not individual herpesvirus transcripts. However, SMRT sequencing allows for a distinction between transcript isoforms, including length- and splice variants, as well as between overlapping polycistronic RNA molecules. The non-amplified Isoform Sequencing (Iso-Seq) method was used to analyse the kinetic properties of the lytic PRV transcripts and to then classify them accordingly. Additionally, the present study demonstrates the general utility of long-read sequencing for the time-course analysis of global gene expression in practically any organism."

The hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the viruses showed multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site, a marker for high virulence in chickens. Of greatest concern was that the viruses displayed amino acid substitution from serine-to-asparagine at position 31 of M2 ion channel protein suggesting emergence of amantadine-resistant mutants not previously reported in HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in India. Amino acid lysine at position 627 of the PB2 protein highlights the risk the viruses possess to mammals.

The causal agent, PPR virus (PPRV), can be separated into four genetically distinct lineages using phylogenetic analysis. In recent decades, lineage IV of PPRV has dramatically extended its geographic distribution from Asia to the Middle East and to Africa, where it has progressively replaced other PPRV lineages. Lineages I and II are historically distributed in West Africa. Currently, lineage II appears to dominate the region, whereas the last recorded occurrence of lineage I dates back to 1994. Recent studies reported the presence of lineage IV in Nigeria, suggesting that this lineage is expanding in West Africa. In Niger, a close neighbour of Nigeria, PPRV has never been genetically characterized, despite reports of PPR incidence. In this study, pathological samples collected from sick goats were collected in 2013 during a suspected PPR outbreak in southern Niger close to the Nigerian border were compared to samples collected in a previous investigation in October 2001 in south-western Niger. These strains were characterized by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to identify their genetic lineage. Our results show that in 2001, lineages I and II were cocirculating in south-western Niger, whereas the strain that caused the outbreak in 2013 belonged to lineage IV and is closely related to strains identified in Nigeria. These results confirm the progression of lineage IV in West Africa. The process of PPRV lineage replacement and its implications for the epidemiology and the control of the disease in this region are unclear and should be the subject of further studies in the field."

In 2003, a reassorted H1N2 swine influenza virus (SIV) subtype appeared and became prevalent in Denmark. In the present study, the reassortant H1N2 subtype was characterised genetically and the infection dynamics compared to an ""avian-like"" H1N1 virus by an experimental infection study. Sequence analyses were performed of the H1N2 virus. Two groups of pigs were inoculated with the reassortant H1N2 virus and an ""avian-like"" H1N1 virus, respectively, followed by inoculation with the opposite subtype four weeks later. Measurements of HI antibodies and acute phase proteins were performed. Nasal virus excretion and virus load in lungs were determined by real-time RT-PCR. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the reassorted H1N2 virus contained a European ""avian-like"" H1-gene and a European ""swine-like"" N2-gene, thus being genetically distinct from most H1N2 viruses circulating in Europe, but similar to viruses reported in 2009/2010 in Sweden and Italy. Sequence analyses of the internal genes revealed that the reassortment probably arose between circulating Danish ""avian-like"" H1N1 and H3N2 SIVs. Infected pigs developed cross-reactive antibodies, and increased levels of acute phase proteins after inoculations. Pigs inoculated with H1N2 exhibited nasal virus excretion for seven days, peaking day 1 after inoculation two days earlier than H1N1 infected pigs and at a six times higher level. The difference, however, was not statistically significant. Pigs euthanized on day 4 after inoculation, had a high virus load in all lung lobes. After the second inoculation, the nasal virus excretion was minimal. There were no clinical sign except elevated body temperature under the experimental conditions. The ""avian-like"" H1N2 subtype, which has been established in the Danish pig population at least since 2003, is a reassortant between circulating swine ""avian-like"" H1N1 and H3N2. The Danish H1N2 has an ""avian-like"" H1 and differs from most other reported H1N2 viruses in Europe and North America/Asia, which have H1-genes of human or ""classical-swine"" origin, respectively. The variant seems, however, also to be circulating in countries like Sweden and Italy. The infection dynamics of the reassorted ""avian-like"" H1N2 is similar to the older ""avian-like"" H1N1 subtype."

The emergence of new virus diseases.,"The sudden appearance of apparently new viruses with pathogenic potential is of fundamental importance in medical microbiology and a constant threat to humans and animals. The emergence of a ""new"" pathogen is not an isolated event, as for instance the frequent appearance of new influenza virus strains demonstrates. Often the new virus strains co-circulate with the older strains in a susceptible population, but a replacement of the older strains has been also observed. In rare instances the new viruses can cause dramatic epidemics or pandemics, such as those observed with the human immunodeficiency virus, canine parvovirus, or most recently, with the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom. The mechanisms of the emergence are not always clearly understood, but an altered host range appears to be a common event. Whether a true change in host range occurs, or whether the virus adapted to the host and replicated more efficiently, is often unknown. This review tries to summarize the facts that are known about a wide variety of ""new"" viruses of mammals, such as the simian, human and feline lentiviruses, the feline coronaviruses, the feline parvoviruses, the carnivore morbilliviruses, the influenza A viruses, and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. A particular emphasis will be put on the genetic mechanisms that might have taken place and that might have been responsible for their sudden appearance."

Type O Taiwan FMD viruses are genetically highly homogenous, as seen by the minute divergence of 0.2-0.9% revealed in 20 variants. The O/HCP-0314/TW/97 and O/TCP-022/TW/97 viral variants dominated FMD outbreaks and were prevalent in most affected pig-raising areas. Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences around the main neutralizable antigenic sites on the VP1 polypeptide showed no significant antigenic variation. However, the O/CHP-158/TW/97 variant had an alternative critical residue at position 43 in antigenic site 3, which may be due to selective pressure in the field. Two vaccine production strains (O1/Manisa/Turkey/69 and O1/Campos/Brazil/71) probably provide partial heterologous protection of swine against O Taiwan viruses. The type O Taiwan variants clustered in sublineage A1 of four main lineages in the phylogenetic tree. The O/Hong Kong/9/94 and O/1685/Moscow/Russia/95 viruses in sublineage A2 are closely related to the O Taiwan variants. The causative agent for the 1997 epidemic presumably originated from a single common source of type O FMD viruses prevalent in neighboring areas."

Since then, a variety of wild carnivores and other wildlife species have been found dead, neurologically ill, or exhibiting aggressive behaviors around the island. To determine the affected animal species, geographic areas, and environments, animal bodies were examined for rabies by direct fluorescent antibody test (FAT). The viral genomes from the brains of selected rabid animals were sequenced for the phylogeny of rabies viruses (RABV). Out of a total of 1016 wild carnivores, 276/831 (33.2%) Formosan FBs were FAT positive, with occasional biting incidents in 1 dog and suspected spillover in 1 house shrew. All other animals tested, including dogs, cats, bats, mice, house shrews, and squirrels, were rabies-negative. The rabies was badger-associated and confined to nine counties/cities in sylvatic environments. Phylogeny of nucleoprotein and glycoprotein genes from 59 Formosan FB-associated RABV revealed them to be clustered in two distinct groups, TWI and TWII, consistent with the geographic segregation into western and eastern Taiwan provided by the Central Mountain Range and into northern rabies-free and central-southern rabies-affected regions by a river bisecting western Taiwan. The unique features of geographic and genetic segregation, sylvatic enzooticity, and FB-association of RABV suggest a logical strategy for the control of rabies in this nation."

Based on these sequences, four proviral copies and 15 solo long terminal repeats (LTRs) of a newly described endogenous retrovirus were characterized from the polar bear draft genome sequence. Closely related sequences were identified by PCR analysis of brown bear (Ursus arctos) and black bear (Ursus americanus) but were absent in non-Ursinae bear species. The virus was therefore designated UrsusERV. Two distinct groups of LTRs were observed including a recombinant ERV that contained one LTR belonging to each group indicating that genomic invasions by at least two UrsusERV variants have recently occurred. Age estimates based on proviral LTR divergence and conservation of integration sites among ursids suggest the viral group is only a few million years old. The youngest provirus was polar bear specific, had intact open reading frames (ORFs) and could potentially encode functional proteins. Phylogenetic analyses of UrsusERV consensus protein sequences suggest that it is part of a pig, gibbon and koala retrovirus clade. The young age estimates and lineage specificity of the virus suggests UrsusERV is a recent cross species transmission from an unknown reservoir and places the viral group among the youngest of ERVs identified in mammals.</jats:p>"

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology gives millions or even billions of sequence reads per run, allowing a comprehensive survey of the genetic content within a sample without prior nucleic acid amplification. In this study, we screened 156 rectal swab samples from apparently healthy bats (n = 96), pigs (n = 9), cattles (n = 9), stray dogs (n = 11), stray cats (n = 11) and monkeys (n = 20) using a HTS metagenomics approach. The complete genome of a novel papillomavirus (PV), Miniopterus schreibersii papillomavirus type 1 (MscPV1), with L1 of 60% nucleotide identity to Canine papillomavirus (CPV6), was identified in a specimen from a Common Bent-wing Bat (M. schreibersii). It is about 7.5kb in length, with a G+C content of 45.8% and a genomic organization similar to that of other PVs. Despite the higher nucleotide identity between the genomes of MscPV1 and CPV6, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the L1 gene sequence showed that MscPV1 and Erethizon dorsatum papillomavirus (EdPV1) are most closely related. Estimated divergence time of MscPV1 from the EdPV1/MscPV1 common ancestor was approximately 60.2-91.9 millions of years ago, inferred under strict clocks using the L1 and E1 genes. The estimates were limited by the lack of reliable calibration points from co-divergence because of possible host shifts. As the nucleotide sequence of this virus only showed limited similarity with that of related animal PVs, the conventional approach of PCR using consensus primers would be unlikely to have detected the novel virus in the sample. Unlike the first bat papillomavirus RaPV1, MscPV1 was found in an asymptomatic bat with no apparent mucosal or skin lesions whereas RaPV1 was detected in the basosquamous carcinoma of a fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus. We propose MscPV1 as the first member of the novel Dyolambda-papillomavirus genus."

In this report, we describe the discovery and genomic characterization of partetraviruses in bovine and ovine samples from China. These partetraviruses were detected by PCR in 1.8% of bovine liver samples, 66.7% of ovine liver samples and 71.4% of ovine spleen samples. One of the bovine partetraviruses detected in the present samples is phylogenetically distinct from previously reported bovine partetraviruses and likely represents a novel genotype. The ovine partetravirus is a novel partetravirus and phylogenetically most related to the bovine partetraviruses. The genome organization is conserved amongst these viruses, including the presence of a putative transmembrane protein encoded by an overlapping reading frame in ORF2. Results from the present study provide further support to the classification of partetraviruses as a separate genus in Parvovirinae."

H9N2 influenza viruses have served as a reservoir of internal genes for other avian influenza viruses that infect humans, and several cases of human infection by H9N2 influenza viruses have indicated its pandemic potential. Fortunately, an extensive surveillance program enables close monitoring of H9N2 influenza viruses worldwide and has generated a large repository of virus sequences and phylogenetic information. Despite the large quantity of sequences in different databases, very little is known about specific virus isolates and their pathogenesis. Here, we characterize a low-pathogenicity avian influenza virus, A/chicken/Israel/810/2001 (H9N2) (Israel810), which is representative of influenza virus strains that have caused severe morbidity and mortality in poultry farms. We show that under certain circumstances the Israel810 hemagglutinin (HA) can be activated by furin, a hallmark of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. We demonstrate that Israel810 HA can be cleaved in cells with high levels of furin expression and that a mutation that eliminates a glycosylation site in HA(1) allows the Israel810 HA to gain universal cleavage in cell culture. Pseudoparticles generated from Israel810 HA, or the glycosylation mutant, transduce cells efficiently. In contrast, introduction of a polybasic cleavage site into Israel810 HA leads to pseudoviruses that are compromised for transduction. Our data indicate a mechanism for an H9N2 evolutionary pathway that may allow it to gain virulence in a distinct manner from H5 and H7 influenza viruses."

In cattle, BPV-1/2 is associated with urinary bladder cancer and BPV-4 with upper GI tract cancer. BPV E5 is a small hydrophobic protein localised in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus (GA). E5 is the major transforming protein of BPVs, capable of inducing cell transformation in cultured mouse fibroblasts and, in cooperation with E7, in primary bovine cells. E5-induced cell transformation is accompanied by activation of several cellular protein kinases, including growth factor receptors, and alkalinisation of endosomes and GA. We have reported that BPV E5 causes swelling and fragmentation of the GA and extensive vacuolisation of the cytoplasm. We now show that E5 from both BPV-1 and BPV-4 disturbs the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions in transformed bovine cells, where these morphological and behavioural characteristics are accompanied by hyperphosphorylation of the cellular phosphotyrosine kinase c-src. Both BPV-1 and BPV-4 E5 increase the motility of transformed mouse cells, but only BPV-1 E5 causes transformed mouse cells to penetrate a matrigel matrix.

Fifty-nine EV-G sequences, which were >5,000 nucleotides long, were obtained. By complete VP1 sequence analysis, Japanese EV-G isolates were classified into G1 (17 strains), G2 (four strains), G3 (22 strains), G4 (two strains), G6 (two strains), G9 (six strains), G10 (five strains), and a new genotype (one strain). Remarkably, 16 G1 and one G2 strain identified in diarrheic (23.5%; four strains) or normal (76.5%; 13 strains) fecal samples possessed a papain-like cysteine protease (PL-CP) sequence, which was recently found in the USA and Belgium in the EV-G genome, at the 2C-3A junction site. This paper presents the first report of the high prevalence of viruses carrying PL-CP in the EV-G population. Furthermore, possible inter- and intragenotype recombination events were found among EV-G strains, including G1-PL-CP strains.

Although numerous studies have identified BEVs in the feces of cattle with diarrhea, the pathogenicity of BEVs remains unclear. Previously, we reported the detection of novel kobu-like virus in calf feces, by metagenomics analysis. In the present study, we identified a novel BEV in diarrheal feces collected for that survey. Complete genome sequences were determined by deep sequencing in feces. Secondary RNA structure analysis of the 5' untranslated region (UTR), phylogenetic tree construction and pairwise identity analysis were conducted. The complete genome sequences of BEV were genetically distant from other EVs and the VP1 coding region contained novel and unique amino acid sequences. We named this strain as BEV AN12/Bos taurus/JPN/2014 (referred to as BEV-AN12). According to genome analysis, the genome length of this virus is 7414 nucleotides excluding the poly (A) tail and its genome consists of a 5'UTR, open reading frame encoding a single polyprotein, and 3'UTR. The results of secondary RNA structure analysis showed that in the 5'UTR, BEV-AN12 had an additional clover leaf structure and small stem loop structure, similarly to other BEVs. In pairwise identity analysis, BEV-AN12 showed high amino acid (aa) identities to Enterovirus F in the polyprotein, P2 and P3 regions (aa identity â¥82.4%). Therefore, BEV-AN12 is closely related to Enterovirus F. However, aa sequences in the capsid protein regions, particularly the VP1 encoding region, showed significantly low aa identity to other viruses in genus Enterovirus (VP1 aa identity â¤58.6%). In addition, BEV-AN12 branched separately from Enterovirus E and F in phylogenetic trees based on the aa sequences of P1 and VP1, although it clustered with Enterovirus F in trees based on sequences in the P2 and P3 genome region. We identified novel BEV possessing highly divergent aa sequences in the VP1 coding region in Japan. According to species definition, we proposed naming this strain as ""Enterovirus K"", which is a novel species within genus Enterovirus. Further genomic studies are needed to understand the pathogenicity of BEVs."

Antisera to two porcine group C rotaviruses and the human group C rotavirus neutralized the Cowden strain at high titers but did not neutralize the Shintoku strain, suggesting that these three strains are serotypically related to the Cowden strain.

Our findings support the existence of at least two distinct serotypes of group C rotaviruses, and possibly a third, among animals and humans.

The presence of this six-nt insertion showed no correlation with the virulence or the reservoir of the NDV strains sequenced so far. The genome length of 15,186 or 15,192 nt can be connected however, to ""old"" (I, II, III and IV) and ""new"" (V, VI, VII and VIII) NDV genotypes, respectively. Comparison of open reading frames indicated that the PPMV-1 strain IT-227/82 encodes the longest W protein, (227 amino acids). The length of the W protein showed remarkable differences even within genotypes and cannot be regarded, therefore, as a phylogenetic feature. The haemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein of strain IT-227/82 consists of 571 amino acids, similarly to genotypes IV, V and VII NDV strains, while genotype I and II strains have longer HN proteins, 616 and 577 amino acids, respectively. The length of the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein possesses phylogenetic importance."

It emerged in the late 1970s in the Mediterranean region. Despite great genetic diversity the vast majority of strains belong to a monophyletic group (sublineage VIb) within genotype VI of NDV strains that were indigenous in the region at that time. To date only a monoclonal antibody assay is available for the specific identification of pigeon type strains. A specific genetic assay is described suitable for the identification of pigeon isolates. Cleavage site analysis of a 1349 bp amplicon of the fusion protein gene was carried out using restriction enzymes (RE) HinfI, BstOI and RsaI. RE analysis of over 100 strains isolated between 1978 and 2002 deriving from 16 countries has revealed nine RE-patterns, which were progressive site variants of the parental (group VI) genotype. In spite of substantial site variation, extant pigeon viruses lacked a BstOI cleavage site at nucleotide 1601 shared by other NDV strains of chicken origin. RE analysis is a simple and reliable method both for the identification and subgrouping of pigeon type viruses."

Two genotypes, BVDV 1 and 2, exist and are discriminated on the basis of the sequence of the 5' non-coding region (5' NCR) using real-time PCR. Real-time PCR is more sensitive, specific, and less time-consuming than conventional PCR, and it has less risk of cross-contamination of samples. Limited information exists on BVDV genetic subtypes in South Africa. The aim of this study was to determine the genotypes of BVDV currently circulating in South African feedlots. A total of 279 specimens (219 tissue samples, 59 trans-tracheal aspirates and 1 blood sample) were collected from dead and living cattle with lesions or clinical signs compatible with BVDV infection. Pooled homogenates from the same animals were prepared, and total RNA was extracted. A screening test was performed on the pooled samples, and positive pools were investigated individually. A Cador BVDV Type 1/2 RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was used for the real-time PCR assay on a LightCycler(Â®) V2.0 real-time PCR machine (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The results were read at 530 and 640 nm for BVDV 1 and 2, respectively. Bovine viral diarrhoea virus was detected in a total of 103 samples that included 91 tissue samples, 1 blood sample and 11 trans-tracheal aspirates. Eighty-five (82.5 %) of the strains were genotype 1 and 18 (17.5 %) were genotype 2. Comparing the sequencing data, genotypes 1 and 2 from the field strains did not cluster with vaccine strains currently used in feedlots in South Africa. The present study revealed the presence of BVDV genotype 2 in cattle in South Africa based on the high sequence similarity between genotype 2 field strains and strain 890 from North America. The presence of genotype 2 viruses that phylogenetically belong to different clusters and coexist in feedlots is consistent with the possibility of multiple virus introductions. These results represent the first documented evidence for the presence of BVDV genotype 2 in African cattle."

All strains had genome lengths of 15,192 nucleotides consisting of six genes in the order of 3'-NP-P/V/W-M-F-HN-L-5'. The general genomic characteristics of the Japanese field strains were consistent with previously characterized class II NDV, except for those belonging to early genotypes (genotype I-IV), which lack the six nucleotide insertion at nucleotide positions 1,648-1,653 of the nucleoprotein (NP) gene. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Japanese strains could be classified into genotypes VIc and VIIe using the complete genome sequence and the complete coding sequence of the fusion (F) gene according to the unified NDV classification system. Characterization of functional domains and neutralizing epitopes of the F and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins of Japanese field strains revealed a total of 31 amino acid substitutions, as compared to vaccine strains Ishii and B1, which were widely used in Japan. Although virus neutralization (VN) test showed that poor flock immunity due to vaccination failure or partial and non-uniform immunization maybe the major factors involved in the mechanism of breakthrough infection of the Japanese field strains, approximately two to threefold decrease in the VN titers of the field NDV strains possessing a point mutation (E347K or E347G) at the linear epitope of the HN protein was observed, as compared to vaccine strain B1 and field strain 2440/69, which lack the point mutation. This study may be a useful reference in characterizing future ND outbreaks in vaccinated chickens and as a genetic map for future investigations regarding vaccine designs, reverse genetics systems, and development of molecular diagnostic tools to prevent future ND outbreaks in vaccinated poultry flocks."

At present, limited molecular epidemiological data are available regarding the causes of ND outbreaks in vaccinated commercial poultry farms. Knowing the genomic characteristics of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infecting commercial poultry operations in spite of vaccination might give important insights on the infection dynamics of these viruses. In addition, molecular analyses at the subgenotype level and studies on the relationship of Japanese NDVs with other isolates from around the world are lacking. Therefore, in the present study, a molecular epidemiological investigation was conducted to characterize nine NDVs isolated from vaccinated commercial poultry flocks in five different Prefectures in non-epidemic areas of Japan between 1969 and 2002. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic studies were performed to characterize the complete fusion (F)-protein gene, 3-prime end of the nucleoprotein (NP)-gene and 5-prime end of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (L)-gene. Sequence data were compared with 180 NDV strains from GenBank representing different NDV genotypes and subgenotypes from different regions of the world at different time periods. Deduced amino acids were analyzed for homologies, recombination and mutation. Recombination events were estimated using Recombination Detection Program (RDP) version 3.44. Phylogenetic trees were constructed to determine evolutionary relationships among strains. Mean death time (MDT: 48-56Â hr), Intracerebral Pathogenicity Index (ICPI: 1.7-1.9) and deduced amino acid sequences of the F0 proteolytic cleavage site (112RRQKR116) revealed that all nine field isolates were velogenic. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these isolates could be classified into two genetic lineages and three sublineages namely genotypes VIa (lineage 4a), VId (lineage 4d) and VIId (lineage 5d). No recombination events were observed but a point mutation in one of the neutralizing epitope of the F-protein was identified in the field isolates from Japan. All field isolates from vaccinated commercial poultry in non-epidemic areas of Japan were part of much bigger outbreaks in provinces and regions and, in some cases, continents. In general, four ND panzootics occurred in Japan and that these outbreaks were mostly characterized by co-circulation of genetically distinct virus lineages due to involvements of infected wild birds. The point mutation identified in the field isolates from Japan may be due to escape from vaccine pressure. The identification of such mutation may be useful for future site-directed mutagenesis to understand the dynamics of NDV infection in vaccinated chickens."

PCR, immunological assays, and enzyme activity tests represent common methods to detect virus infections. We have screened more than 300 Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia RNA sequencing and 60 whole exome sequencing human cell lines data sets for specific viral sequences and general viral nucleotide and protein sequence assessment applying the Taxonomer bioinformatics tool developed by IDbyDNA. The results were compared with our previous findings from virus specific PCR analyses. Both, the results obtained from the direct alignment method and the Taxonomer alignment method revealed a complete concordance with the PCR results: twenty cell lines were found to be infected with five virus species. Taxonomer further uncovered a bovine polyomavirus infection in the breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3 most likely introduced by contaminated fetal bovine serum. RNA-Seq data sets were more sensitive for virus detection although a significant proportion of cell lines revealed low numbers of virus specific alignments attributable to low level nucleotide contamination during RNA preparation or sequencing procedure. Low quality reads leading to Taxonomer false positive results can be eliminated by trimming the sequence data before analysis. One further important result is that no viruses were detected that had never been shown to occur in cell cultures. The results prove that the currently applied testing of cell cultures is adequate for the detection of contamination and for the risk assessment of cell cultures. The results emphasize that next generation sequencing is an efficient tool to determine the viral infection status of human cells."

We detected, by in-house EIA, BuV1-3 IgG antibodies in 7/228 children (3.1%) and 10/180 adults (5.6%), whereas TuV IgG was found in one child (0.4%). All children and 91% of the adults were Finnish, yet interestingly 3/6 adults of Indian origin were BuV-IgG positive. By competition EIA, no cross-reactivity between the BuVs was detected, indicating that the BuV genotypes represent distinct serotypes. Furthermore, we analysed by BuV qPCR stool and nasal swab samples from 955 children with gastroenteritis, respiratory illness, or both, and found BuV DNA in three stools (0.3%) and for the first time in a nasal swab (0.1%). This is the first study documenting the presence of BuV and TuV antibodies in humans. Although the seroprevalences of both viruses were low in Finland, our results indicate that BuV infections might be widespread in Asia. The BuV-specific humoral immune responses appeared to be strong and long-lasting, pointing to systemic infection in humans.</jats:p>"

The virus exists in a wide variety of genetically distinct viral types, and both phylogenetic analysis and measures of pairwise similarity among nucleotide or amino acid sequences have been used to classify IBV strains. However, there is currently no consensus on the method by which IBV sequences should be compared, and heterogeneous genetic group designations that are inconsistent with phylogenetic history have been adopted, leading to the confusing coexistence of multiple genotyping schemes. Herein, we propose a simple and repeatable phylogeny-based classification system combined with an unambiguous and rationale lineage nomenclature for the assignment of IBV strains. By using complete nucleotide sequences of the S1 gene we determined the phylogenetic structure of IBV, which in turn allowed us to define 6 genotypes that together comprise 32 distinct viral lineages and a number of inter-lineage recombinants. Because of extensive rate variation among IBVs, we suggest that the inference of phylogenetic relationships alone represents a more appropriate criterion for sequence classification than pairwise sequence comparisons. The adoption of an internationally accepted viral nomenclature is crucial for future studies of IBV epidemiology and evolution, and the classification scheme presented here can be updated and revised novel S1 sequences should become available."

Although all flocks harboured seropositive animals, virus could only be isolated from animals in five of the flocks. Between 4 and 11 months later all animals older than 6 months in three of the flocks were resampled. At this time, 51-83% of them had neutralizing antibodies. The prevalence of persistently infected (PI) animals within two of the flocks was 0.3 and 0.6%, respectively. The third flock presumably had eliminated all the PI animals. Fourteen virus isolates were obtained. The 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) was amplified by RT-PCR and directly sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses classified them as a group of Border disease viruses (BDV), separated from BDV-1, but showing a relatively low bootstrap value. Three of the 14 isolates were in the same subgroup as a set of formerly characterised Spanish isolates from the Basque Country, which were allocated to subgroup BDV-C. In addition, they were in the group with an isolate from chamois, which is currently allocated in group BDV-4. Because of its close relation to the chamois isolate, these isolates were tentatively reallocated in a subgroup BDV-4a. The remaining isolates generated a new subgroup, related but not in the same cluster as the chamois isolate, and was therefore tentatively assigned to a new subgroup BDV-4b. Our results show that classification and nomenclature of BDV needs to be harmonised."

Viral metagenomics identifies genetic variation and contaminating circoviruses in laboratory isolates of pigeon paramyxovirus type 1.,"We used next generation sequencing on random amplified viral nucleic acids to determine the genome sequence of 11 pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1) isolates from Belgium (period 1998-2011). The PPMV-1 deep sequence data allowed identification of sequence variability in multiple PPMV-1 isolates, including one STOP codon in the Matrix gene which was present in 15% of the viral population of one isolate. Notably, mutations that were previously associated with pathogenicity in chickens were identified as minor sequence variants in one parent laboratory strain. A phylogenetic analysis of the consensus PPMV-1 genome sequences was performed. In addition to providing nearly complete paramyxovirus genome sequences, our sequence-independent approach identified the presence of pigeon circovirus (PiCV) sequences in four of these viral stocks. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis specific for PMV-1 and PiCV showed that these contaminations were present in seven viral stocks consisting of allantoic fluids and was occasionally also detected in stocks passaged in embryonated chicken eggs. Phylogenetic analysis of the PiCV consensus genome sequences showed a circulation of PiCV covering the full genetic diversity of known PiCV. This study shows the value of novel sequence independent technologies for access to sequence information for the control of reference virus stocks and other biological materials, as co-infecting viruses or sequence variants from the original sample may persist in the stocks without being identified by the routine virus-specific diagnostic tools. The exact role of PiCV in pigeon disease - in particular Newcastle disease - and its potential interference with PPMV-1 diagnostics remains to be investigated."

HEV genotype 3 (Gt3) infections are endemic in pigs in Western Europe and in North and South America and cause zoonotic infections in humans. Several serological assays to detect HEV antibodies in pigs have been developed, at first mainly based on HEV genotype 1 (Gt1) antigens. To develop a sensitive HEV Gt3 ELISA, a recombinant baculovirus expression product of HEV Gt3 open reading frame-2 was produced and coated onto polystyrene ELISA plates. After incubation of porcine sera, bound HEV antibodies were detected with anti-porcine anti-IgG and anti-IgM conjugates. For primary estimation of sensitivity and specificity of the assay, sets of sera were used from pigs experimentally infected with HEV Gt3. For further validation of the assay and to set the cutoff value, a batch of 1100 pig sera was used. All pig sera were tested using the developed HEV Gt3 assay and two other serologic assays based on HEV Gt1 antigens. Since there is no gold standard available for HEV antibody testing, further validation and a definite setting of the cutoff of the developed HEV Gt3 assay were performed using a statistical approach based on Bayes' theorem. The developed and validated HEV antibody assay showed effective detection of HEV-specific antibodies. This assay can contribute to an improved detection of HEV antibodies and enable more reliable estimates of the prevalence of HEV Gt3 in swine in different regions."

Classification of this virus has been based on partial sequence analysis of cDNA from a virus-producing cell line, PH969. We obtained the complete nucleotide sequence of this virus with a proviral genome of 8,916 bp. All major genes, homologous in all human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-related viruses, and their corresponding mRNAs, including appropriate splicing, were identified. One additional nonhomologous open reading frame in the proximal pX region is accessible for translation through alternative splicing. Sequence comparison shows that STLV-PH969 is equidistantly related to HTLV type 1 (HTLV-1) and HTLV-2. In all coding regions, the similarity tends to be the lowest between STLV-PH969 and HTLV-1. However, in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region, the lowest similarity was found between STLV-PH969 and HTLV-2. The U3-R and R-U5 boundaries of the STLV-PH969 LTR were experimentally determined at nucleotides 268 and 524, respectively. This 695-bp LTR is 60 and 73 bp shorter than the LTRs of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, respectively, but its general organization is similar to the one found in the HTLV-bovine leukemia virus genus. In the long region between the polyadenylation signal and the poly(A) site, sequence similarity with the HTLV-1 Rex-responsive element (RexRE) core and secondary structure prediction suggest the presence of a RexRE. The presence of three 21-bp repeats is conserved within the U3 region of HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and BLV. Only two direct repeats with similarity to these Tax-responsive elements were found in the STLV-PH969 LTR, which might suggest differences in the Tax-mediated transactivation of this virus. We conclude that STLV-PH969 has all the genes and genomic regions to suggest a replication cycle comparable to that of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2.</jats:p>"

Investigation into the genetic heterogeneity of the regions encoding these proteins from isolates of six FMDV serotypes revealed the 3C proteinase to be more conserved than the Leader proteinase. Maximum likelihood analysis indicated similar phylogenetic groupings for the non-structural protein coding regions of both the Leader and 3C. These groupings were different from the structural VP1 protein coding region which, as shown previously, grouped according to serotype. Two distinct clades were apparent for both the Leader and 3C coding regions: one comprising of serotypes A, O and C together with SAT (South African Territories) isolates from eastern Africa. The other clade consisted of SAT isolates originating from southern Africa. Only one virus isolate, obtained from a buffalo in Uganda, did not conform to this phylogenetic pattern. This SAT 1 virus grouped with types A, O and C in the Leader analysis, but with the southern African SAT types in the 3C analysis, implicating intertypic recombination. The leader proteinases of southern African SAT type isolates differed from those present in European type isolates, particularly in the self-processing region. A three-dimensional structure was modeled for the Leader proteinase of one of the SAT type viruses, ZIM/7/83/2, and compared with the previously elucidated crystal structure of O(1)Kaufbeuren Leader proteinase. The active sites of the two leaders were found to superimpose closely, despite the observed sequence variation between the two molecules. Comparison of the 3C proteinase P1 cleavage sites suggested that the FMDV 3C proteinase may possess a broader substrate specificity, as observed in hepatitis A virus 3C proteinase."

Amino acids from all eight segments were concatenated, aligned, and used for phylogenetic analyses. In addition, the genes of the polymerase complex (PB1, PB2, and PA) were analyzed individually. All of our results showed the Brevig-Mission/1918 strain in a position basal to the rest of the clade containing human H1N1s and were consistent with a reassortment hypothesis for the origin of the 1918 virus. Our genome phylogeny further indicates a sister relationship with the ""classic"" swine H1N1 lineage. The individual PB1, PB2, and PA phylogenies were consistent with reassortment/recombination hypotheses for these genes. These results demonstrate the importance of using a complete-genome approach for addressing the avian-origin hypothesis and predicting the emergence of new pandemic influenza strains."

We review recent progress in virology and provide examples of how it is informing both empirical research in field ecology and applied conservation. We include a discussion of needed breakthroughs and ways to bridge communication gaps between the field and the lab. In an effort to foster this interdisciplinary effort, we have also included a table that lists the definitions of key terms. The importance of understanding the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in their reservoir hosts is emphasized as a tool to both assess risk factors for spillover and to test hypotheses related to treatment and/or intervention strategies. In conclusion, we highlight the need for smart surveillance, viral discovery efforts and predictive modeling. A shift towards a predictive approach is necessary in today's globalized society because, as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic demonstrated, identification post-emergence is often too late to prevent global spread. Integrating molecular virology and ecological techniques will allow for earlier recognition of potentially dangerous pathogens, ideally before they jump from wildlife reservoirs into human or livestock populations and cause serious public health or conservation issues."

The disease is endemic in pigs, emerging in horses and has also been reported in a variety of other animal species, including nonhuman primates. Comparing the whole genome sequences of a homologous porcine L. intracellularis isolate cultivated for 10 and 60 passages in vitro, we identified a 18-kb prophage-associated genomic island in the passage 10 (pathogenic variant) that was lost in the passage 60 (non-pathogenic variant). This chromosomal island comprises 15 genes downstream from the prophage DLP12 integrase gene. The prevalence of this genetic element was evaluated in 12 other L. intracellularis isolates and in 53 infected animals and was found to be conserved in all porcine isolates cultivated for up to 20 passages and was lost in isolates cultivated for more than 40 passages. Furthermore, the prophage region was also present in 26 fecal samples derived from pigs clinically affected with both acute and chronic forms of the disease. Nevertheless, equine L. intracellularis isolates evaluated did not harbor this genomic island regardless of the passage in vitro. Additionally, fecal samples from 21 clinically affected horses and four wild rabbits trapped in horse farms experiencing PE outbreaks did not show this prophage-associated island. Although the presence of this prophage-associated island was not essential for a virulent L. intracellularis phenotype, this genetic element was porcine isolate-specific and potentially contributed to the ecological specialization of this organism for the swine host."

We here report on two patients from Thuringia (Germany) with a HEV infection without a recent stay abroad. All other common causes of hepatitis were excluded. Transaminases were significantly increased in both cases, while icterus could be proven in one patient, only. Both patients fully recovered in the long-term course. Epidemiological and phylogenetic data from viral analyses suggest that HEV infection has to be considered as a zoonosis. It is likely that viral transmission from animals to humans occurs through insufficiently cooked meat or entrails, e. g., from pigs or wild animals. In summary, HEV infection is a relevant differential diagnosis in acute non-A/B/C viral hepatitis. Further studies are required for the identification of other transmission pathways, pathogen reservoirs as well as novel concepts for prophylaxis, especially for patients at risk for hepatic diseases."

Our phylogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of different PPV species in Mexico, and their phylogenetic relationship with other PPV circulating in the US and Canada. Furthermore, we describe the existence of two different ORFV phylogenetic groups that are clearly host associated (sheep or goat). Evidence of directional selection at five specific amino acid residues in the enveloped glycoprotein B2L might help to support this host predilection.

The mechanisms that drive AIV evolution are complex at sites where various duck and gull species from multiple flyways breed, winter, or stage. The Republic of Georgia is located at the intersection of three migratory flyways: the Central Asian flyway, the East Africa/West Asia flyway, and the Black Sea/Mediterranean flyway. For six complete study years (2010 to 2016), we collected AIV samples from various duck and gull species that breed, migrate, and overwinter in Georgia. We found a substantial subtype diversity of viruses that varied in prevalence from year to year. Low-pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) subtypes included H1N1, H2N3, H2N5, H2N7, H3N8, H4N2, H6N2, H7N3, H7N7, H9N1, H9N3, H10N4, H10N7, H11N1, H13N2, H13N6, H13N8, and H16N3, and two highly pathogenic AIVs (HPAIVs) belonging to clade 2.3.4.4, H5N5 and H5N8, were found. Whole-genome phylogenetic trees showed significant host species lineage restriction for nearly all gene segments and significant differences in observed reassortment rates, as defined by quantification of phylogenetic incongruence, and in nucleotide sequence diversity for LPAIVs among different host species. Hemagglutinin clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 viruses, which circulated in Eurasia during 2014 and 2015, did not reassort, but analysis after their subsequent dissemination during 2016 and 2017 revealed reassortment in all gene segments except NP and NS. Some virus lineages appeared to be unrelated to AIVs in wild bird populations in other regions, with maintenance of local AIVs in Georgia, whereas other lineages showed considerable genetic interrelationships with viruses circulating in other parts of Eurasia and Africa, despite relative undersampling in the area."

In several European countries, including Belgium, the virus has successfully been eradicated from the domestic swine population. The presence of PRV in the wild boar population however poses a risk for possible reintroduction of the virus into the domestic pig population. It is therefore important to assess the genetic relatedness between circulating strains and possible epidemiological links. In this study, nine historical Belgian domestic swine isolates that circulated before 1990 and five recent wild boar isolates obtained since 2006 from Belgium and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg were genetically characterized by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and phylogenetic analysis. While all wild boar isolates were characterized as type I RFLP genotypes, the RFLP patterns of the domestic swine isolates suggest that a shift from genotype I to genotype II might have occurred in the 1980s in the domestic population. By phylogenetic analysis, Belgian wild boar isolates belonging to both clade A and B were observed, while all domestic swine isolates clustered within clade A. The joint phylogenetic analysis of both wild boar and domestic swine strains showed that some isolates with identical sequences were present within both populations, raising the question whether these strains represent an increased risk for reintroduction of the virus into the domestic population."

Virus-derived peptides are presented to cytotoxic T lymphocytes by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) transports the peptides from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum, where the loading of MHC-I molecules occurs. The varicelloviruses bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), pseudorabies virus, and equid herpesviruses 1 and 4 have been found to encode a UL49.5 protein that inhibits TAP-mediated peptide transport. To investigate to what extent UL49.5-mediated TAP inhibition is conserved within the family of Alphaherpesvirinae, the homologs of another five varicelloviruses, one mardivirus, and one iltovirus were studied. The UL49.5 proteins of BoHV-5, bubaline herpesvirus 1, cervid herpesvirus 1, and felid herpesvirus 1 were identified as potent TAP inhibitors. The varicella-zoster virus and simian varicellovirus UL49.5 proteins fail to block TAP; this is not due to the absence of viral cofactors that might assist in this process, since cells infected with these viruses did not show reduced TAP function either. The UL49.5 homologs of the mardivirus Marek's disease virus 1 and the iltovirus infectious laryngotracheitis virus did not block TAP, suggesting that the capacity to inhibit TAP via UL49.5 has been acquired by varicelloviruses only. A phylogenetic analysis of viruses that inhibit TAP through their UL49.5 proteins reveals an interesting hereditary pattern, pointing toward the presence of this capacity in defined clades within the genus Varicellovirus."

Some of these viruses were closely related to known viruses while others were more distantly related with 70% or less identity to currently known/sequenced viruses.

            We analyzed viral nucleic acids in stool samples collected from 35 South Asian children with nonpolio acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). Sequence-independent reverse transcription and PCR amplification of capsid-protected, nuclease-resistant viral nucleic acids were followed by DNA sequencing and sequence similarity searches. Limited Sanger sequencing (35 to 240 subclones per sample) identified an average of 1.4 distinct eukaryotic viruses per sample, while pyrosequencing yielded 2.6 viruses per sample. In addition to bacteriophage and plant viruses, we detected known enteric viruses, including rotavirus, adenovirus, picobirnavirus, and human enterovirus species A (HEV-A) to HEV-C, as well as numerous other members of the
            <jats:italic>Picornaviridae</jats:italic>

Viral nucleic acids in trivalent oral poliovirus (OPV), rubella, measles, yellow fever, varicella-zoster, multivalent measles/mumps/rubella, and two rotavirus live vaccines were partially purified, randomly amplified, and pyrosequenced. Over half a million sequence reads were generated covering from 20 to 99% of the attenuated viral genomes at depths reaching up to 8,000 reads per nucleotides. Mutations and minority variants, relative to vaccine strains, not known to affect attenuation were detected in OPV, mumps virus, and varicella-zoster virus. The anticipated detection of endogenous retroviral sequences from the producer avian and primate cells was confirmed. Avian leukosis virus (ALV), previously shown to be noninfectious for humans, was present as RNA in viral particles, while simian retrovirus (SRV) was present as genetically defective DNA. Rotarix, an orally administered rotavirus vaccine, contained porcine circovirus-1 (PCV1), a highly prevalent nonpathogenic pig virus, which has not been shown to be infectious in humans. Hybridization of vaccine nucleic acids to a panmicrobial microarray confirmed the presence of endogenous retroviral and PCV1 nucleic acids. Deep sequencing and microarrays can therefore detect attenuated virus sequence changes, minority variants, and adventitious viruses and help maintain the current safety record of live-attenuated viral vaccines."

Since its identification and characterization in the early 1990s, PCV-2 has achieved a worldwide distribution, becoming endemic in most pig-producing countries, and is currently considered as the main cause of losses on pig farms. In this study, we analyzed the main routes of the spread of PCV-2 between pig-producing countries using phylogenetic and phylogeographical approaches. A search for PCV-2 genome sequences in GenBank was performed, and the 420 PCV-2 sequences obtained were grouped into haplotypes (group of sequences that showed 100% identity), based on the infinite sites model of genome evolution. A phylogenetic hypothesis was inferred by Bayesian Inference for the classification of viral strains and a haplotype network was constructed by Median Joining to predict the geographical distribution of and genealogical relationships between haplotypes. In order to establish an epidemiological and economic context in these analyses, we considered all information about PCV-2 sequences available in GenBank, including papers published on viral isolation, and live pig trading statistics available on the UN Comtrade database (http://comtrade.un.org/). In these analyses, we identified a strong correlation between the means of PCV-2 dispersal predicted by the haplotype network and the statistics on the international trading of live pigs. This correlation provides a new perspective on the epidemiology of PCV-2, highlighting the importance of the movement of animals around the world in the emergence of new pathogens, and showing the need for effective sanitary barriers when trading live animals."

However, the molecular pathogenesis of HPAIV infection in crows and other wild birds is not well known. Thus, as a step to explore it, a comprehensive global gene expression analysis was performed on crow lungs, infected with HPAI H5N1 crow isolate (A/Crow/India/11TI11/2011) using high throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) (GS FLX Titanium XLR70). The reference genome of crow is not available, so RNA seq analysis was performed on the basis of a de novo assembled transcriptome. The RNA seq result shows, 4052 genes were expressed uniquely in noninfected, 6277 genes were expressed uniquely in HPAIV infected sample and of the 6814 genes expressed in both samples, 2279 genes were significantly differentially expressed. Our transcriptome profile data allows for the ability to understand the molecular mechanism behind the recent lethal HPAIV outbreak in crows which was, until recently, thought to cause lethal infections only in gallinaceous birds such as chickens, but not in wild birds. The pattern of differentially expressed genes suggest that this isolate of H5N1 virus evades the host innate immune response by attenuating interferon (IFN)-inducible signalling possibly by down regulating the signalling from type I IFN (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) and type II IFN receptors, upregulation of the signalling inhibitors suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3 and altering the expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs). This may be the reason for disease and mortality in crows."

Based on genetic similarities, coronaviruses are classified into three groups. Two group 2 coronaviruses, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV), show remarkable antigenic and genetic similarities. In this study, we report the first complete genome sequence (30,738 nucleotides) of the prototype HCoV-OC43 strain (ATCC VR759). Complete genome and open reading frame (ORF) analyses were performed in comparison to the BCoV genome. In the region between the spike and membrane protein genes, a 290-nucleotide deletion is present, corresponding to the absence of BCoV ORFs ns4.9 and ns4.8. Nucleotide and amino acid similarity percentages were determined for the major HCoV-OC43 ORFs and for those of other group 2 coronaviruses. The highest degree of similarity is demonstrated between HCoV-OC43 and BCoV in all ORFs with the exception of the E gene. Molecular clock analysis of the spike gene sequences of BCoV and HCoV-OC43 suggests a relatively recent zoonotic transmission event and dates their most recent common ancestor to around 1890. An evolutionary rate in the order of 4 x 10(-4) nucleotide changes per site per year was estimated. This is the first animal-human zoonotic pair of coronaviruses that can be analyzed in order to gain insights into the processes of adaptation of a nonhuman coronavirus to a human host, which is important for understanding the interspecies transmission events that led to the origin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak."

In RT-PCR the selected fragment was amplified from the genomes of 27 viral strains collected from Europe, America and Asia over a period of a half century as well as from three vaccine strains of CSFV. Eight PCR products were sequenced using an automatic sequencing device. Nucleotide sequence analysis was performed by computer programs DNASTAR and PHYLIP. The comparative studies revealed that the 3'-NC region contains a variable region of nucleotides which is located immediately after the stop codon TGA or TAA. Furthermore, a strongly conserved constant region was identified near to the extreme 3'-terminus. Two imperfect repeated sequences were found both in the variable and in the constant regions. In addition, the variable region was characterized by the occurrence of a 50 bp long poly AT track. Phylogenetic analysis with different mathematical approaches (MegAlign, Neighbor-Joining method, Maximum Likelihood, Parsimony) revealed that the studied CSFV strains were clustered into two main phylogenetic groups. Group I was comprised of the reference strain Brescia, together with old American and European field isolates and a Brazilian vaccine strain. Group II included the reference strain Alfort (TÃ¼bingen) and recent European field strains. The Congenital Tremor strain formed a distinct lineage which, although being highly divergent, was more closely related to group I than to group II. In conclusion, the present phylogenetic grouping yielded very similar results as previous studies base on comparison of the E2 (gp55) region. The agreement of the phylogenetic analysis in the two distinct regions confirms the reliability of the genetic grouping of CSFV strains into two main genogroups."

BVDV isolates were usually typed based on comparison of genomic sequences from the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR), N(pro) and E2 region. Recently we have identified 11 genetic groups (subgenotypes) of BVDV-1. Our further experiments confirmed a new subgenotype, BVDV-1k, isolated from cattle in Switzerland. BVDV isolates from India were typed as BVDV-1b whereas BVDV-1c is a predominant subgenotype in Australia. The results of genetic typing of BVDV indicate that distribution of subgenotypes has no relationship to the geographic origin of viral isolates."

For this, 288bp fragments from the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR). The products were sequenced and used for phylogenetic analysis. Seventy virus isolates were typed as BVDV species 1 (BVDV-1). Only one isolate was typed as BVDV species 2 (BVDV-2), representing the first isolate of this pestivirus genotype found in Austria. In addition, phylogenetic analysis revealed that viruses belonging to five genetic groups within BVDV-1 are circulating in Styria. Most viruses (53) were found in group BVDV-1f, nine viruses in BVDV-1h, four viruses in BVDV-1b, three viruses in BVDV-1d and one virus in BVDV-1g. No virus was found in genetic group BVDV-1a, which is dominant in the UK and widely distributed in USA. Likewise, the BVDV isolates predominating in a neighbouring country, namely Germany, belonged to different genogroups than those circulating in Styria. We conclude that in a particular region and environment certain BVDV-1 genetic groups predominate. New groups, including BVDV-2, can be introduced, e.g. by trade of animals. The low incidence of BVDV-2 in Styria is in concert with the sporadic occurrence of these viruses in other regions of Europe."

Parts of the E2 (gp55) and the polymerase gene coding regions of the viral genome were amplified by RT-PCR and DNA fragments of 254 and 207 bp, respectively, were sequenced. The comparative sequence analysis of the E2 region revealed two main phylogenetic groups of CSFV, indicating that the virus apparently evolved from two ancestor nodes. Group I (represented by Brescia strain) consisted of old and recent American and Asian viruses, as well as old English isolates from the 1950s. This group was subdivided into three subgroups, termed I.A-I.C. Group II (represented by Alfort strain) consisted of relatively recent isolates from Europe, together with strain Osaka, which was isolated in Japan from a pig of European origin. Based on genetic distances the group was divided into subgroups II.A and II.B. Malaysian isolates were branched into both groups, indicating multiple origins for contemporaneous outbreaks in that country. All ten vaccine strains tested were branched in group I, implying a common ancestor. The Japanese Kanagawa strain, isolated in 1974, and the British Congenital Tremor strain from 1964 were the most distinct variants of CSFV in our collection. The comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the polymerase coding region of 32 European strains distinguished subgroups II.A and II.B which were similar to the corresponding subgroups of the E2 phylogenetic tree. Thus, the results revealed that the E2 region and the polymerase coding regions seem to be appropriate for the grouping of CSFV isolates from all over the world, distinguishing two major groups of the virus. The reliability of these regions for phylogenetic analysis is indicated by the similarity of the results obtained from the two separate parts of the CSFV genome."

Hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease and accumulating evidence indicates that domestic pigs and wild boars are the main reservoirs of HEV-3. A detailed analysis of HEV-3 subtypes could help to determine the interplay of human activity, the role of animals as reservoirs and cross species transmission. Although complete genome sequences are most appropriate for HEV subtype determination, in most cases only partial genomic sequences are available. We therefore carried out a subtype classification analysis, which uses regions from all three open reading frames of the genome. Using this approach, more than 1000 published HEV-3 isolates were subtyped. Newly recovered HEV partial sequences from hunted German wild boars were also included in this study. These sequences were assigned to genotype 3 and clustered within subtype 3a, 3i and, unexpectedly, one of them within the subtype 3b, a first non-human report of this subtype in Europe."

Despite the enormous data output from high-throughput shotgun sequencing, viral DNA in a clinical sample typically constitutes a proportion of host DNA that is too small to be detected. Sequence variation among virus genomes complicates application of sequence-specific, and highly sensitive, PCR methods. Therefore, we aimed to develop and characterize a method that permits sensitive detection of sequences despite considerable variation. We demonstrate that our low-stringency in-solution hybridization method enables detection of <100 viral copies. Furthermore, distantly related proviral sequences may be enriched by orders of magnitude, enabling discovery of hitherto unknown viral sequences by high-throughput sequencing. The sensitivity was sufficient to detect retroviral sequences in clinical samples. We used this method to conduct an investigation for novel retrovirus in samples from three cancer types. In accordance with recent studies our investigation revealed no retroviral infections in human B-cell lymphoma cells, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or colorectal cancer biopsies. Nonetheless, our generally applicable method makes sensitive detection possible and permits sequencing of distantly related sequences from complex material."

Piglets 2-4 days of age and their dams were administered an oronasal PDCoV inoculum with a quantitative real-time reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR quantification cycle (Cq) value of 22 that was generated from a field sample having 100% nucleotide identity to USA/Illinois121/2014 determined by metagenomic sequencing and testing negative for other enteric disease agents using standard assays.

Diarrhea developed in all inoculated and contact control pigs, including dams, by 2 days post-inoculation (dpi) and in aerosol control pigs and dams by 3-4 dpi, with resolution occurring by 12 dpi. Mild to severe atrophic enteritis with PDCoV antigen staining was observed in the small intestine of affected piglets from 2 to 8 dpi. Mesenteric lymph node and small intestine were the primary sites of antigen detection by immunohistochemistry, and virus RNA was detected in these tissues to the end of the study.

However, whether bats are equally competent hosts of non-viral pathogens such as bacteria remains an important open question. Here, we surveyed blood and saliva samples of vampire bats from Peru and Belize for hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. (hemoplasmas), bacteria that can cause inapparent infection or anemia in hosts. 16S rRNA gene amplification of blood showed 67% (150/223) of common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) were infected by hemoplasmas. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed three novel genotypes that were phylogenetically related but not identical to hemoplasmas described from other (non-vampire) bat species, rodents, humans, and non-human primates. Hemoplasma prevalence in vampire bats was highest in non-reproductive and young individuals, did not differ by country, and was relatively stable over time (i.e., endemic). Metagenomics from pooled D. rotundus saliva from Peru detected non-hemotropic Mycoplasma species and hemoplasma genotypes phylogenetically similar to those identified in blood, providing indirect evidence for potential direct transmission of hemoplasmas through biting or social contacts. This study demonstrates vampire bats host several novel hemoplasmas and sheds light on risk factors for infection and basic transmission routes. Given the high frequency of direct contacts that arise when vampire bats feed on humans, domestic animals, and wildlife, the potential of these bacteria to be transmitted between species should be investigated in future work."

The so-called 'hygiene hypothesis' has since undergone numerous modifications in the field of epidemiology, clinical science and immunology. Three main areas of research have been brought forward: to explore the role of overt viral and bacterial infections for the inception of allergic diseases; to investigate the significance of environmental exposure to microbial compounds on the development of allergies; and to study the effect of both exposures on underlying innate and adaptive immune responses. A concept unifying these various aspects has not been found, but various pieces of a complex interplay between immune responses of the host, characteristics of the invading microorganism, the level and variety of the environmental exposure and the interactions between an exposed subject's genetic background and the environmental exposures becomes apparent. A natural experiment relating to the hygiene hypothesis is the recurrent observation of a protective effect of growing up on a farm for asthma and allergies. This has been shown in a large number of epidemiological studies across the world among children and adults. The timing and duration of exposure are likely to play a critical role. The largest reduction in risk has been demonstrated for those exposed prenatally and continuously thereafter until adulthood. The protective factors in these farming environments have not been unravelled completely. Findings from various studies suggest that the contact with farm animals, at least in childhood, confers protection. Also the consumption of unprocessed cow's milk directly from the farm has been shown to protect from childhood asthma and allergies. Increased levels of microbial substances may, at least in part, contribute to the 'farm effect'. However, only few studies have measured microbial exposures in these environments and the results obtained so far suggest that the underlying protective microbial exposure(s) have not been identified, but a number of studies using metagenomic approaches are currently under way. The mechanisms by which such environmental exposures confer protection from respiratory allergies are also not well understood. There is good evidence for the involvement of innate immune responses, but translation into protective mechanisms for asthma and allergies is lacking. Furthermore, a number of gene x environment interactions have been observed."

In this study, the polyprotein coding region of the South African strain SA-KZN95 was sequenced and analysed along with 52 representative sequences of other serotype I and II strains. We explored the relative impact of recombination on phylogenetic reconstruction using a multidimensional scaling approach. Phylogenetic analyses consistently placed the South African isolate within the very virulent IBDV clade. Selection analyses were also conducted to identify evolutionarily relevant amino acid residues. Previously, 19 residues in the polyprotein were shown to be potentially diagnostic for the different IBDV pathotypes. This study identified an additional two unique residues in the polyprotein which may be used as genetic signatures in future viral identifications. Better strain identification would aid in the development and application of vaccines."

Two MDV challenge isolates (MPF57 or MPF23) were administered to unvaccinated specific-pathogen free (SPF) layer chicks on day 5 after hatch at three challenge doses (500, 2000 or 8000 plaque-forming units (pfu)/chick). Mortality, body weight, immune organ weights, MDV load in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and clinical signs were measured to 56 days post challenge (dpc). MPF23 was the more pathogenic of the two viruses, inducing higher mortality (81% vs 62%) and incidence of MD lesions (100% vs 76%). MPF23 induced earlier, more sustained and more severe neurological signs in the period 26-56 dpc. However, there were few differences during the 0-23 dpc used in the neuropathotyping classification under test. The observed pattern during this earlier period classified both viruses as neuropathotype B, consistent with a very virulent pathotype. MDV load in PBL at 7 and 44 dpc did not differ between virus isolates, but the load at 7 dpc was significantly and negatively associated with time to euthanasia or death. MPF23 appears to be as, or more, virulent than the MDV strains isolated over the subsequent two decades. The neuropathotyping system developed in the USA did not clearly differentiate between the two isolates under test; however, extension of the period of assessment of clinical signs beyond 26 dpc did reveal clear differences."

Currently, the effects of biological treatment (composting) on the transcriptional response of manure ARGs and their microbial hosts are not well characterized. Composting is a dynamic process that consists of four distinct phases that are distinguished by the temperature resulting from microbial activity, namely the mesophilic, thermophilic, cooling, and maturing phases. In this study, changes of resistome expression were determined and related to active microbiome profiles during the dynamic composting process. This was achieved by integrating metagenomic and time series metatranscriptomic data for the evolving microbial community during composting. Composting noticeably reduced the aggregated expression level of the manure resistome, which primarily consisted of genes encoding for tetracycline, vancomycin, fluoroquinolone, beta-lactam, and aminoglycoside resistance, as well as efflux pumps. Furthermore, a varied transcriptional response of resistome to composting at the ARG levels was highlighted. The expression of tetracycline resistance genes (tetM-tetW-tetO-tetS) decreased during composting, where distinctive shifts in the four phases of composting were related to variations in antibiotic concentration. Composting had no effect on the expression of sulfonamide and fluoroquinolone resistance genes, which increased slightly during the thermophilic phase and then decreased to initial levels. As indigenous populations switched greatly throughout the dynamic composting, the core resistome persisted and their reservoir hosts' composition was significantly correlated with dynamic active microbial phylogenetic structure. Hosts for sulfonamide and fuoroquinolone resistance genes changed notably in phylognetic structure and underwent an initial increase and then a decrease in abundance. By contrast, hosts for tetracycline resistance genes (tetM-tetW-tetO-tetS) exhibited a constant decline through time. The transcriptional patterns of a core resistome over the course of composting were identified, and microbial phylogeny was the key determinant in defining the varied transcriptional response of resistome to this dynamic biological process. This research demonstrated the benefits of composting for manure treatment. It reduced the risk of emerging environmental contaminants such as tetracyclines, tetracycline resistance genes, and clinically relevant pathogens carrying ARGs, as well as RNA viruses and bacteriophages."

To clarify the virus spectrum of mild and severe HFMD, a comprehensive virome analysis of 238 samples was performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The data revealed total thirteen mammalian- and plant- virus families and diverse viral populations including enteroviruses, common respiratory viruses, diarrhea-related viruses, plant viruses and anelloviruses. A total of 18 viruses from 7 virus families were identified in severe cases, versus 37 viruses from 12 virus families in mild cases. Moreover, complicated mixed-infections of enteroviruses with common respiratory viruses were mainly found in severe cases(Pâ¯=â¯0.013), while diarrhea-related viruses were mainly found in mild cases(Pâ¯<â¯0.001). This study provides the preliminary understanding of viromes both in mild and severe cases, which may benefit the detection of etiologic agents and prevention of HFMD."

The GX871 genome included 10 segments and 18914 bp, one base fewer than the CHUV prototype strain K-47 due to a one-base deletion in the 5' non-coding region of segment 8. A frameshift mutation was detected in a short coding region (1010-1026 nt) corresponding to the VP1 protein; this frameshift resulted in a five-amino acid mutation from 336CVLSY340 to 336YGAKL340. In addition, there were a one-base deletion at 1713 nt and a one-base insertion at 1682 nt in the 3' non-coding region of segment 5. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the deduced VP2 amino acid sequences, Palyam serogroup viruses were classified into three groups. The Chinese CHUV isolate GX871 was categorized into the same group as CHUV prototype strain K-47. The phylogenetic tree was divided into three clusters according to the geographical distribution of the partial nucleotide sequences of VP7, and this arrangement might define the geographical gene pool of CHUV."

Due to the lack of influenza surveillance prior to these outbreaks, the genetic diversity and the transmission pathways of H5N1 viruses from this period remain undefined. To determine the possible source of the wave 1 H5N1 viruses, we recently conducted further sequencing and analysis of samples collected in live-poultry markets from Guangdong, Hunan, and Yunnan in southern China from 2001 to 2004. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of 73 H5N1 isolates from this period revealed a greater genetic diversity in southern China than previously reported. Moreover, results show that eight viruses isolated from Yunnan in 2002 and 2003 were most closely related to the clade 1 virus sublineage from Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, while two viruses from Hunan in 2002 and 2003 were most closely related to viruses from Indonesia (clade 2.1). Further phylogenetic analyses of the six internal genes showed that all 10 of those viruses maintained similar phylogenetic relationships as the surface genes. The 10 progenitor viruses were genotype Z and shared high similarity (>/=99%) with their corresponding descendant viruses in most gene segments. These results suggest a direct transmission link for H5N1 viruses between Yunnan and Vietnam and also between Hunan and Indonesia during 2002 and 2003. Poultry trade may be responsible for virus introduction to Vietnam, while the transmission route from Hunan to Indonesia remains unclear."

Sequence analysis shows several amino acid residue substitutions at neutralizing epitopes on the F and HN proteins of recent Shaanxi strains. Both Cross protection and cross serum neutralization tests revealed that the traditional vaccine strains were unable to provide full protection for the flocks. To better understand the epidemiology of Newcastle disease outbreak, a portion of the F gene and the full-length HN gene were amplified from Shaanxi isolates by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and then conducted sequence and phylogenetic analyzes. In pathogenicity analysis, both high intra-cerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and mean death time (MDT) tests of chicken embryo were carried out. Furthermore, a cross-protection experiment in which specific-pathogen-free chickens vaccinated with a LaSota vaccine strain were challenged by the recent Shaanxi strain was also performed. Nine Newcastle disease (ND) virus (NDV) isolates which were recovered from ND outbreaks in chicken flocks in China were genotypically and pathotypically characterized. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that all the recent Shaanxi-isolated NDVs have (112)R-R-Q-K-R-F(117) for the C-terminus of the F2 protein and exhibit high ICPI and MDT of chicken embryos, suggesting that they were all classified as velogenic type of NDVs. Phylogenetic analysis of these isolates showed that they belong to subgenotype VIId that have been implicated in the recent outbreaks in northwestern China. The percentage of amino acid sequence identity of F protein between recent Shaanxi stains and five vaccine strains was in the range of 81.9 %-88.1 %, while the percentage of amino acid sequence identity of HN protein between recent Shaanxi strains and vaccine strains was in the range of 87.4 %-91.2 %. Furthermore, a number of amino acid residue substitutions at neutralizing epitopes on the F and HN proteins of these isolates were observed, which may lead to the change of antibody recognition and neutralization capacity. A cross-protection experiment indicated that specific-pathogen-free chickens vaccinated with a LaSota vaccine strain was not capable of providing full protection for the flocks that were challenged by the recent Shaanxi strain. Taken together, our findings reveal that recent Shannxi NDVstrains exhibit antigenic variations that could be responsible for recent outbreaks of NDVs in northwestern China."

Phylogenetic analysis on the basis of VP1 sequences demonstrated three distinct genetic groups. There was an excellent concordance among the genetic groups assigned based on the complete VP0, VP3, and the partial 3D regions. In view of the growing importance of molecular techniques in diagnosis, we propose that the three genetic groups should be termed DHV types A, B, and C. All DHV-1 strains grouped in genotype A, whereas the new serotype strains isolated in Taiwan and the new serotype strains isolated in South Korea clustered into genotypes B and C, respectively, suggesting a potential genetic correlates of serotype. In pairwise comparisons of complete VP1, VP0, and VP3 nucleotide and amino acid sequences and the partial 3D nucleotide sequence, DHVs of the same genotype were clearly distinguished from those of heterologous genotypes. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of the three capsid proteins demonstrated the presence of conserved elements that form the eight-stranded beta-barrel structures, as well as intervening domains that vary in sequence between strains of different genotypes as seen in other picorna viruses."

Knowledge of the miRNAs affected by poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of viral double-stranded RNA, in porcine airway epithelial cells (PAECs) contributes to understanding the mechanisms of swine viral respiratory diseases, which bring enormous economic loss worldwide every year. In this study, we used high throughput sequencing to profile miRNA expression in PAECs treated with poly(I:C) as compared to the untreated control. This approach revealed 23 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), five of which have not been implicated in viral infection before. Nineteen of the 23 miRNAs were down-regulated including members of the miR-17-92 cluster, a well-known polycistronic oncomir and extensively involved in viral infection in humans. Target genes of DEMs, predicted using bioinformatic methods and validated by luciferase reporter analysis on two representative DEMs, were significantly enriched in several pathways including transforming growth factor-Î² signaling. A large quantity of sequence variations (isomiRs) were found including a substitution at position 5, which was verified to redirect miRNAs to a new spectrum of targets by luciferase reporter assay together with bioinformatics analysis. Twelve novel porcine miRNAs conserved in other species were identified by homology analysis together with cloning verification. Furthermore, the expression analysis revealed the potential importance of three novel miRNAs in porcine immune response to viruses. Overall, our data contribute to clarifying the mechanisms underlying the host immune response against respiratory viruses in pigs, and enriches the repertoire of porcine miRNAs."

The results of electron microscopy, hemagglutination (HA) assay, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, and whole genome sequencing analysis suggest that it was a reassortant virus of swine (H1N1 subtype), human (H3N2 subtype), and avian influenza viruses. To further study the genetic evolution of A/Swine/Fujian/F1/2010 (H1N2), we cloned its whole genome fragments using RT-PCR and performed phylogenetic analysis on the eight genes. As a result, the nucleotide sequences of HA, NA, PB1, PA, PB2, NP, M, and NS gene are similar to those of A/Swine/Shanghai/1/2007(H1N2) with identity of 98.9%, 98.9%, 99.0%, 98.6%, 99.0%, 98.9%, 99.3%, and 99.3%, respectively.

Out of 9 Enterovirus species, Enterovirus E-G are closely related to diseases affecting on livestock industry. While enterovirus infection has been increasingly reported in cattle and swine, the enterovirus infections in small ruminants remain largely unknown. Virology, molecular and bioinformatics methods were employed to characterize a novel enterovirus CEV-JL14 from goats manifesting severe diarrhea with morbidity and mortality respectively up to 84% and 54% in China. CEV-JL14 was defined and proposed as a new Enterovirus species L within the genus of Enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae. CEV-JL14 had a complete genome sequence of 7461 nucleotides with an ORF encoding 2172 amino acids, and shared 77.1% of genomic sequence identity with TB4-OEV, an ovine enterovirus. Comparison of 5'-UTR and structural genes of CEV-JL14 with known Enterovirus species revealed highly genetic variations among CEV-JL14 with known Enterovirus species.

We have identified 53 potential open reading frames, including three genes (the c repressor gene and early genes A and B) that have been previously characterized and sequenced. The organization of the putative coding regions corresponds to published genetic and transcriptional maps and is very similar to that of enterobacteriophage Mu.

Similarity-based analyses identified 27 open reading frames with significant matches to proteins in the NCBI databases.

Recently, genetically diverse porcine NoVs (genotypes 11, 18, and 19 within GII) and SaVs comprising at least two genogroups (GIII and GVI?/JJ681-like) and two unclassified strains (G?/QW19 and G?/LL26) were identified; however, their prevalence has not been reported. To investigate the prevalence of porcine NoVs and SaVs, 621 fecal samples were collected from swine of various ages from seven swine farms and one slaughterhouse in three states in the United States. Fecal samples were tested by reverse transcription-PCR and microwell hybridization assays with porcine NoV- and SaV-specific primers and probes, respectively. Porcine GII NoVs were detected exclusively from finisher pigs with an overall prevalence of 20%. Porcine GIII SaVs were detected in 62% of pigs, with the highest prevalence in postweaning pigs and lowest in nursing pigs. Porcine GVI?/JJ681-like SaVs and the G?/QW19-like SaVs were detected infrequently in pigs. The G?/LL26-like SaVs were detected mainly in younger pigs. Because some porcine NoVs and SaVs are genetically or antigenically related to human strains and recombinants within NoVs or SaVs occur for human and pig strains, the high prevalence and subclinical infection rate of these viruses in pigs raise questions of whether pigs may be reservoirs for human strains or for the emergence of new human and porcine recombinants."

Here we employed a statistical method to evaluate the evolutionary relationships between individual viral genes and full-length genomes without tree construction as a way to determine which gene can match the genome well in phylogenetic analyses. This method was performed by calculation of linear correlations between the genetic distance matrices of aligned individual gene sequences and aligned genome sequences. We applied this method to the phylogenetic analyses of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), measles virus (MV), hepatitis E virus (HEV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Phylogenetic trees were constructed for comparisons and the possible factors affecting the method accuracy were also discussed in the calculations. The results revealed that this method could produce results consistent with those of previous studies about the proper consensus sequences that could be successfully used as phylogenetic markers. And our results also suggested that these evolutionary correlations could provide useful information for identifying genes that could be used effectively to infer the genetic relationships."

The hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein mediates virus binding, contains antigenic regions recognized by neutralizing antibodies, and is associated with viral cross-species infection and adaption. The comparison study of codon usage preferences in influenza viral genomes was less extensive. In this study, we used codon usage pattern analyses to validate the adaption and origins of S-OIV. Codon usage pattern was used to estimate the host adaption of S-OIVs. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene was conducted to understand the phylogeny of H1N1 viruses isolated from different hosts. Amino acid signature pattern on antigenic sites of HA was analyzed to understand the antigenic characteristics. Results of phylogenetic analyses of HA gene indicate that S-OIVs group in identical clusters. The synonymous codon usage pattern analyses indicate that the effective number of codons versus GC content at the third codon position in the HA1 gene slightly differ from those in swine H1N1 and gradually adapted to human. Our data indicate that S-OIV evolution occurred according to positive selection within these antigenic regions.

Here, we report 39 circulating CV-A6 strains isolated in 2013 from HFMD patients in northeast China. Three major clusters of CV-A6 were identified and related to CV-A6, mostly from Shanghai, indicating that domestic CV-A6 strains were responsible for HFMD emerging in northeast China. Four full-length CV-A6 genomes representing each cluster were sequenced and analyzed further. Bootscanning tests indicated that all four CV-A6-Changchun strains were most likely recombinants between the CV-A6 prototype Gdula and prototype CV-A4 or CV-A4-related viruses, while the recombination pattern was related to, yet distinct from, the strains isolated from other regions of China. Furthermore, different CV-A6 strains showed different capabilities of viral replication, release, and pathogenesis in a mouse model. Further analyses indicated that viral protein 2C contributed to the diverse pathogenic abilities of CV-A6 by causing autophagy and inducing cell death. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report lethal and nonlethal strains of CV-A6 associated with HFMD. The 2C protein region may play a key role in the pathogenicity of CV-A6 strains.</jats:p>

            Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a major and persistent threat to infants and children. Besides the most common pathogens, such as enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), other enteroviruses are increasingly contributing to HFMD. The present study focused on the recently emerged CV-A6 strain. We found that CV-A6 strains isolated in Changchun City in northeast China were associated with domestic origins. These Changchun viruses were novel recombinants of the CV-A6 prototype Gdula and CV-A4. Our results imply that measures to control CV-A6 transmission are urgently needed. Further analyses revealed differing pathogenicities in strains isolated in a neonatal mouse model. One of the possible causes has been narrowed down to the viral protein 2C, using phylogenetic studies, viral sequences, and direct tests on cultured human cells. Thus, the viral 2C protein is a promising target for antiviral drugs to prevent CV-A6-induced tissue damage.

          <jats:p>
            Although shrews are one of the largest groups of mammals, little is known about their role in the evolution and transmission of viral pathogens, including coronaviruses (CoVs). We captured 266 Asian house shrews (
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Suncus murinus</jats:named-content>
            ) in Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provinces, China, during 2013 to 2015. CoV RNA was detected in 24 Asian house shrews, with an overall prevalence of 9.02%. Complete viral genome sequences were successfully recovered from the RNA-positive samples. The newly discovered shrew CoV fell into four lineages reflecting their geographic origins, indicative of largely allopatric evolution. Notably, these viruses were most closely related to alphacoronaviruses but sufficiently divergent that they should be considered a novel member of the genus
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Alphacoronavirus</jats:named-content>
            , which we denote WÃ©nchÃ©ng shrew virus (WESV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that WESV was a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and, more dramatically, that the S gene of WESV fell in a cluster that was genetically distinct from that of known coronaviruses. The divergent position of WESV suggests that coronaviruses have a long association with Asian house shrews. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that exhibits no sequence similarity to genes of any known viruses. Together, these data suggest that shrews are natural reservoirs for coronaviruses and may have played an important and long-term role in CoV evolution.

            The subfamily
            <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Coronavirinae</jats:named-content>
            contains several notorious human and animal pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Because of their genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships, it has been proposed that the alphacoronaviruses likely have their ultimate ancestry in the viruses residing in bats. Here, we describe a novel alphacoronavirus (WÃ©nchÃ©ng shrew virus [WESV]) that was sampled from Asian house shrews in China. Notably, WESV is a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and possesses an S gene that is genetically distinct from those of all known coronaviruses. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that exhibits no sequence similarity to those of any known viruses. Together, these data suggest that shrews are important and longstanding hosts for coronaviruses that merit additional research and surveillance.

The virus was shown to have a picornavirus-like genome layout. Interestingly, the genome contained a total of up to six 2As, including four 2As (2A1-2A4) each having an NPGP motif, an AIG1-like 2A5, and a parechovirus-like 2A6. The 5'UTR was predicted to possess a hepacivirus/pestivirus-like internal ribosome entry site (IRES). However, the subdomain IIIe consisted of a 3 nt stem and five unpaired bases, distinct from those found in all other HP-like IRESs. The virus was most closely related to duck hepatitis A virus, with amino acid identities of 37.7â%, 39â% and 43.7â% in the P1, P2 and P3 regions, respectively. Based on these investigations, together with phylogenetic analyses, the virus could be considered as the founding member of a novel picornavirus genus that we tentatively named 'Aalivirus', with 'Aalivirus A' as the type species."

In the present study, the complete genomic characterization of a strain of type 1 PRRSV (designated GZ11-G1) was described and its pathogenicity for piglets was analyzed. The results showed that the complete genome of GZ11-G1 with a size of 15,094 nt, excluding the poly (A) tails, shared 80.2-96.3% identity with the representative strains of type 1 PRRSV, and in particular, it had highest homology (96.3%) with Amervac PRRS, a live vaccine virus of type 1 PRRSV and SHE, a rescued virus from an infectious clone of Amervac PRRS virus. Compared with the vaccine virus, the nonstructural and structural proteins of GZ11-G1 displayed extensive amino acid variations except for its ORF5a. GZ11-G1 was clustered with the strains of type 1 PRRSV including Cresa3267, Cresa3249, Cresa3256, Olot/91, 9625/2012, ESP-1991-Olot91 and Amervac PRRS vaccine virus by further phylogenetic analysis. Moreover, GZ11-G1 was shown to cause fever, higher viremia and lung and lymph node lesions in piglets. Our findings indicate that GZ11-G1 is genetically related to type 1 PRRSV strains within the cluster formed by Cresa3267, Cresa3249, Cresa3256, Olot/91, 9625/2012, ESP-1991-Olot91 and Amervac PRRS vaccine virus, and it is a pathogenic for piglets.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the host-EDSV interaction remains unclear. Here, we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to study the dynamic changes in host gene expression at 6, 12, and 24 hours post-infection in duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) infected with EDSV. Atotal of 441 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified after EDSV infection. Gene Ontology category and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis revealed that these DEGs were associated with multiple biological functions, including signal transduction, host immunity, virus infection, cell apoptosis, cell proliferation, and pathogenicity-related and metabolic process signaling pathways. We screened and identified 12 DEGs for further examination by using qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq results were highly consistent. This study analyzed viral infection and host immunity induced by EDSV infection from a novel perspective, and the results provide valuable information regarding the mechanisms underlying host-EDSV interactions, which will prove useful for the future development of antiviral drugs or vaccines for poultry, thus benefiting the entire poultry industry."

The cleavage site of the viral F protein (Fcs) is a key determinant of membrane fusion and viral virulence. In this study, we investigated the precise effect of variable amino acid sequences of the Fcs on fusogenic activity. Based on viral pathogenicity, the Fcs sequences of natural isolates (n = 1572) are classified into eight types of virulent Fcs (VFcs) with the motif ""G/R/K-R-Q/R/K-R/K-RâF"" and ten types of the avirulent Fcs (AFcs) with the motif ""G/R/E-R/K/Q-Q-G/E-RâL"". The VFcs is only found in the Class II cluster of viral classification and not in Class I. The AFcs exists in both Class I and II isolates. The VFc and AFc types present an evolutionary relationship with temporal distribution and host species. Using a fusion assay in vitro, VFcs-1 ""RRQKRâF"" and VFcs-2 ""RRQRRâF"" show the highest efficiency in triggering membrane fusion. The neutral residue Q at the P3 position of the VFcs plays an enhancing role compared to effect of the basic residues R and K. A single residue K at P3 or P5 is less efficient of the fusogenic activity in the VFcs with all basic residues. Moreover, the cleavage efficiencies of F0 proteins with different types of Fcs motifs do not appear to affect membrane fusion. Our findings offer insight into the effect of amino acid variation of the Fcs on the fusion triggered by NDV."

The two strains are characterized by distinct insertion of a papain-like protease gene from toroviruses classified within the Coronaviridae family. According to recent reports the site of the torovirus protease insertion was located at the 2C/3A junction region in EVG 02/NC_CHI/2014. For the other variant EVG 01/NC_CHI/2014, the inserted protease sequence replaced the entire viral capsid protein region up to the VP1/2A junction. These two EV-G strains were highly prevalent in the same pig farm with all animals shedding the full-length genome (EVG 02/NC_CHI/2014) while 65% also shed the capsid deletion mutant (EVG 01/NC_CHI/2014).

All of these sequences have the same genomic organization, which contains open reading frames (ORFs) 1, 2, and 3, although their genomic sequences are variable. Some have proposed that they be classified as new family, Hepeviridae, which would be further divided into different genera and species according to their sequence variability. The size of these virus particles generally ranged from 27 to 34 nm. However, HEV virions produced in cell culture differ in structure from the viruses found in feces. Those from cell culture have a lipid envelope and a little ORF3 on their surfaces, whereas the viruses isolated from feces lack lipid envelope and ORF3. Surprisingly, most of the secreted ORF2 protein from both these sources is not associated with HEV RNA."

Continuous circulation of H5N1 virus in Egypt, from a single infected source, has led to significant genetic diversification with phylogenetically separable sublineages, providing an opportunity to study the impact of genetic evolution on viral phenotypic variation. In this study, we analysed the phylogeny of H5 haemagglutinin (HA) genes in influenza viruses isolated in Egypt from 2006 to 2011 and investigated the effect of conserved amino acid mutations in the HA genes in each of the sublineages on their antigenicity. The analysis showed that viruses in at least four sublineages still persisted in poultry in Egypt as of 2011. Using reverse genetics to generate HA-reassortment viruses with specific HA mutations, we found antigenic drift in the HA in two influenza virus sublineages, compared with the other currently co-circulating influenza virus sublineages in Egypt. Moreover, the two sublineages with significant antigenic drift were antigenically distinguishable. Our findings suggested that phylogenetically divergent H5N1 viruses, which were not antigenically cross-reactive, were co-circulating in Egypt, indicating that there was a problem in using a single influenza virus strain as seed virus to produce influenza virus vaccine in Egypt and providing data for designing more efficacious control strategies in H5N1-endemic areas."

Pestivirus A may cause persistent infection in that calves excrete the virus throughout their lives, spreading the infection in the herd. Many persistently infected (PI) calves die in the first 2Â years of life from mucosal disease (MD) or secondary infections, probably as a consequence of virus-induced immune depression. Here, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) was applied for evaluation of the total virome in sera of (i) PI calves displaying clinically apparent MD (nâ=â8); (ii) PI calves with no signs of MD (nâ=â8); and (iii) control, Pestivirus A-free calves (nâ=â8). All the groups were collected at the same time and from the same herd. Serum samples from calves in each of the groups were pooled, submitted to viral RNA/DNA enrichment, and sequenced by HTS. Viral genomes of Pestivirus A, Ungulate erythroparvovirus 1, bosavirus (BosV), and hypothetical circular Rep-encoding single-stranded DNA (CRESS-DNA) viruses were identified. Specific real-time PCR assays were developed to determine the frequency of occurrence of such viruses in each of the groups. The absolute number of distinct viral genomes detected in both PI calf groups was higher than in the control group, as revealed by higher number of reads, contigs, and genomes, representing a wider range of taxons. Genomes representing members of the family Parvoviridae, such as U. erythroparvovirus 1 and BosV, were most frequently detected in all the three groups of calves. Only in MD-affected PI calves, we found two previously unreported Hypothetical single-stranded DNA genomes clustered along with CRESS-DNA viruses. These findings reveal that parvoviruses were the most frequently detected viral genomes in cattle serum; its frequency of detection bears no statistical correlation with the status of calves in relation to Pestivirus A infection, since clinically normal or MD-affected/non-affected PI calves were infected with similar U. erythroparvovirus 1 genome loads. Moreover, MD-affected PI calves were shown to support viremia of CRESS-DNA viral genomes; however, the meaning of such correlation remains to be established."

Such a development may pose an increased risk of disease transmission between boars and domestic animals. The wild boar population has increased in South America in the last years due the absence of predator causing economic losses due to direct damage to crops and risk of disease transmission. The genus Pestivirus within the family Flaviviridae are composed by four recognized species by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV): classical swine fever virus (CSFV), border disease virus (BDV), bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 (BVDV-1) and 2 (BVDV-2). Other putative species denoted as atypical pesitiviruses have been reported as âHoBiâ-like virus, giraffe pestivirus, Bungowannah pestivirus, Pronghorn antelope virus, atypical porcine pestivirus (APPV), Norwegian rat pestivirus (NrPV) and Rhinolophus affinis bat pestivirus (RaPestV-1). CSFV is commonly detected in wild boars, but despite positive serology, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) was never detected in this animal species. Thereby, the present communication describes the first detection of BVDV in the lungs of captive boars using RT-PCR and DNA sequencing.Materials, Methods &amp; Results: Forty lung samples from farmed wild boars were collected after slaughter in a commercial abattoir. The organs were crushed separately, centrifuged, and the supernatant was stored for further analysis. The total RNA was isolated using a phenol-based protocol and RT-PCR protocol that amplified 118 bp of 5â untranslated region (5âUTR) was carried out. One out 40 samples resulted positive. The positive sample had partial fragments of 5âUTR and N terminal autoprotease (Npro) sequenced and analyzed. The strain LV Java/2012 presented 99% of identity in 5âUTR and 98% in Npro region with a BVDV-2 previously reported in bovines in Southern Brazil. In both 5âUTR and Npro phylogenetic analysis, the strain LV Java/2015 clustered with BVDV-2 strains and was most closely related to subtype 2b identified in bovines in Southern Brazil grouping in the same terminal node.Discussion: Wild boars are commonly associated to pathogen transmission to domestic animals. This animal species is considered a reservoir of the pestivirus CSFV and important keys in CSFV control and eradication programs in Europe. Despite indirect presence of BVDV was reported in wild boars by serology tests, the direct detection of the viral agent was never reported. The present study showed the presence of BVDV-2 genomic segments obtained by RT-PCR followed by DNA sequencing in captive wild boars. The reported data suggests a possible importance of this animal species in the epidemiology of ruminant pestiviruses which could interfere in control and eradication programs of these important pathogens for cattle worldwide. The strain LV Java/2012 was closely related to BVDV-2b and presented highest identity with a strain detected in cattle from Southern Brazil. This data suggests that wild boars and bovines could be sharing this pathogen due the similarity of the strains and that both were reported in the same region. It can lead to need of inclusion of wild swines in BVDV control programs since boars can circulate between different regions and carry this pathogen to different cattle herds. The present study reported the first molecular evidence of BVDV in wild boars in the literature. The data generated herein suggests a possible importance of boars in the epidemiology of ruminant pestiviruses.</jats:p>"

Here, we have analysed all eight gene segments of 168 H9N2 genomes sampled randomly aiming to provide a panoramic framework for better understanding the genesis and genetic variation of the viruses, and utilized phylogeography and spatial epidemiology approaches to uncover the effects of the genetic variation, predictors and spread of H9N2 viruses. We found that more frequent reassortment events involve segments PA, NP and NS, and 21 isolates have possible mosaic structure resulting from recombination events. Estimates of gene-specific global dN/dS ratios showed that all genes were subject to purifying selection. However, a total of 13 sites were detected under positive selection by at least two of three methods, which located within segments HA, NA, M2, NS1 and PA. Additionally, we inferred that NA segment has the highest rate of nucleotide substitution, and its tMRCA estimate is the youngest than the remaining segments' inference. About the spatial history, air transportation of human was identified as the predominant driver of global viral migration using GLM analysis, and economic factors and geographical distance were the modest predictors. Higher migration rates were estimated between five pairs of regions (>0.01) indicating the frequent migration of the viruses between discrete geographical locations. Further, our Markov jumps analysis showed that viral migration is more frequent between Southern China and Northern China, and high rate of gene flow was observed between America and East Asia. Moreover, the America together with Southeast Asia acted as the primary hubs of global transmission, forming the trunk of evolutionary tree. These findings suggested a complex interaction between virus evolution, epidemiology and human behaviour."

In late April 2009, viruses phylogenetically related to pandemic H1N1 influenza virus were isolated from an outbreak on a Canadian pig farm. This outbreak also had epidemiological links to a suspected human case. Experimental infections carried out in pigs using one of the swine isolates from this outbreak and the human isolate A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009 showed differences in virus recovery from the lower respiratory tract. Virus was consistently isolated from the lungs of pigs infected with A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009, while only one pig infected with A/swine/Alberta/OTH-33-8/2008 yielded live virus from the lung, despite comparable amounts of viral RNA and antigen in both groups of pigs. Clinical disease resembled other influenza virus infections in swine, albeit with somewhat prolonged virus antigen detection and delayed viral-RNA clearance from the lungs. There was also a noteworthy amount of genotypic variability among the viruses isolated from the pigs on the farm. This, along with the somewhat irregular pathobiological characteristics observed in experimentally infected animals, suggests that although the virus may be of swine origin, significant viral evolution may still be ongoing."

APVs are distributed worldwide and cause disease in domestic, pet and wild birds of many species. APVs are transmitted by aerosols and biting insects, particularly mosquitoes and arthropods and are usually named after the bird species from which they were originally isolated. The virus species Fowlpox virus (FWPV) causes disease in poultry and associated mortality is usually low, but in flocks under stress (other diseases, high production) mortality can reach up to 50%. APVs are also major players in viral vaccine vector development for diseases in human and veterinary medicine. Abortive infection in mammalian cells (no production of progeny viruses) and their ability to accommodate multiple gene inserts are some of the characteristics that make APVs promising vaccine vectors. Although abortive infection in mammalian cells conceivably represents a major vaccine bio-safety advantage, molecular mechanisms restricting APVs to certain hosts are not yet fully understood. This review summarizes the current knowledge relating to APVs, including classification, morphogenesis, host-virus interactions, diagnostics and disease, and also highlights the use of APVs as recombinant vaccine vectors."

Factors that initiate protein misfolding and the role of protein aggregation in the pathophysiology of disease pose major challenges to the neuroscientific community. Interestingly, although the accumulation of the same misfolded protein, e.g., Î±-synuclein is detectable in all idiopathic PD patients, the disease spectrum covers a variety of different clinical presentations and disease courses. In a more recent attempt this clinical variance is being explained in analogy to prion diseases by different protein aggregate conformations. In prion diseases a relationship between protein aggregate conformation properties and the clinical disease course was shown by relating different prion types to a dementia and an ataxic disease course in Creutzfeldt-Jakob patients. This principle is currently transferred to AD, PD and other neurodegenerative diseases with protein aggregation. However, differences in protein aggregate conformation are frequently addressed as disease strains. The term ""strain"" also derives from prion research and evolved by adopting the virus terminology at a time when transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs; later called prion diseases) were assumed to be caused by a virus. The problem is that in virus taxonomy the term ""type"" refers to properties of the disease agent itself and the term ""strain"" refers to host associated factors that interact with the disease agent and may moderately modify the clinical disease presentation. Strain factors can be discovered only after transmission and passaging of the agent in a host of a different species. The incorrect use of the terminology confuses disease agent and host factors and hampers the understanding of the pathophysiology of protein aggregate-associated neurodegenerative diseases. In this review article the discoveries are reviewed that explain how the terms ""type"" and ""strain"" emerged for unconventional disease agents. This may help to avoid confusion in the terminology of protein aggregation diseases and to reflect correctly the impact of protein aggregate conformation as well as host factor contribution on different clinical variations of AD, PD and other neurodegenerative diseases."

However, there might be some concerns on the methodology application to define the genotype of DuCV. Taking into account the concerns mentioned above, our authors conducted the PASC analyses of 54 capsid gene (ORF2) and genomic sequences including all the sequences from Zhang et al. (2013). Our results confirmed the existence of two DuCV genotypes (1 and 2) and, we suggest that DuCV ORF2 and genomic distance genotype thresholds were 0.061 and 0.038, respectively."

In contrast to travel associated hepatitis E, zoonotic sources of infection are suspected for autochthonous cases in Europe. Since pigs are known reservoirs of HEV, we tested porcine livers sold as food in Southeastern Germany for the presence of hepatitis E virus RNA. We purchased 200 porcine liver samples in 81 butcher shops and grocery stores in Regensburg, Germany. Nucleic acid preparations were tested for the presence of HEV RNA by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). HEV isolates from positive samples were characterized by partial sequencing of ORF1 and ORF2 regions in the HEV genome and by phylogenetic analysis. Specimens from eight (4%) of 200 purchased pig livers had detectable HEV RNA amounts. Sequence determination and phylogenetic analysis allowed two novel isolates to be classified as HEV genotype 3, subgenotype 3a (swR437) and 3c (swR269), respectively. Both novel swine HEV isolates showed high sequence homology to isolates obtained from patients with acute HEV infection from the same geographic region. These results support the suggested role of undercooked pig products in food as a source of zoonotic HEV infection for humans. It remains to be clarified if this mechanism of transmission is responsible for the surprisingly high anti-HEV IgG prevalence recently observed in some European countries and the USA."

After exclusion of classical endemic and emerging viruses by targeted diagnostic systems, blood samples from acutely diseased cows were subjected to metagenomics analysis. An insect-transmitted orthobunyavirus of the Simbu serogroup was identified as the causative agent and named Schmallenberg virus (SBV). It was one of the first detections of the introduction of a novel virus of veterinary importance to Europe using the new technology of next-generation sequencing. The virus was subsequently isolated from identical samples as used for metagenomics analysis in insect and mammalian cell lines and disease symptoms were reproduced in calves experimentally infected with both, this culture-grown virus and blood samples of diseased cattle. Since its emergence, SBV spread very rapidly throughout the European ruminant population causing mild unspecific disease in adult animals, but also premature birth or stillbirth and severe fetal malformation when naive dams were infected during a critical phase of gestation. In the following years, SBV recirculated regularly to a larger extend; in the 2014 and 2016 vector seasons the virus was again repeatedly detected in the blood of adult ruminants, and in the following winter and spring months, a number of malformed calves and lambs was born. The genome of viruses present in viremic adult animals showed a very high sequence stability; in sequences generated between 2012 and 2016, only a few amino acid substitutions in comparison to the initial SBV isolate could be detected. In contrast, a high sequence variability was identified in the aminoterminal part of the glycoprotein Gc-encoding region of viruses present in the brain of malformed newborns. This mutation hotspot is independent of the region or host species from which the samples originated and is potentially involved in immune evasion mechanisms."

Neighbor-joining trees of F and M protein sequences showed that the Paramyxoviridae was divided into the two traditionally recognized subfamilies, the Paramyxovirinae and the Pneumovirinae. Within the Paramyxovirinae, the results also showed groups corresponding to three currently recognized genera: Respirovirus, Morbillivirus, and Rubulavirus. The relationships among the three genera of the Paramyxovirinae were resolved with M protein sequences and there was significant bootstrap support (100%) showing that members of the genus Respirovirus and the genus Morbillivirus were more closely related to each other than to members of the genus Rubulavirus. Both F and M phylogenies showed that Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was more closely related to the genus Rubulavirus than to the other two genera but were consistent with the proposal (B. S.

No significant alignment to any known avian virus sequence was obtained from any faecal samples. However significant BLAST alignments to five bacteriophages known to infect enterobacteria were obtained. Strong evidence was obtained for the presence of the bacteriophage Escherichia phage TL-2011b, a bacteriophage known to occur in Escherichia coli causing outbreaks of foodborne disease in humans, in the sample from the diseased bird, but not the non-diseased pool. Differences in E. coli community structure between the diseased bird and the non-diseased pool were also apparent.

A total of 1,115 serum samples collected from apparently healthy individuals in Bali, Lombok, and Surabaya in Indonesia in 1996 where epidemic HEV transmissions have never been reported, were tested for IgG class antibodies to HEV (anti-HEV). In Bali, anti-HEV was detected in 20% (54/276) of the tested population, in remarkable contrast with 4% (17/446) in Lombok and 0.5% (2/393) in Surabaya. On the other hand, antibodies to hepatitis A virus were highly prevalent in all three regions (95% in Bali, 90% in Lombok, and 89% in Surabaya).

Therefore, we investigated the ecology and emergence of influenza viruses by conducting phylogenetic analysis of 70 matrix (M) genes of influenza viruses isolated from shorebirds and gulls in the Delaware Bay region and from ducks in Alberta, Canada, during >18 years of surveillance. In our analysis, we included 61 published M genes of isolates from various hosts. We showed that M genes of Canadian duck viruses and those of shorebird and gull viruses in the Delaware Bay shared ancestors with the M genes of North American poultry viruses. We found that North American and Eurasian avian-like lineages are divided into sublineages, indicating that multiple branches of virus evolution may be maintained in wild aquatic birds. The presence of non-H13 gull viruses in the gull-like lineage and of H13 gull viruses in other avian lineages suggested that gulls' M genes do not preferentially associate with the H13 subtype or segregate into a distinct lineage. Some North American avian influenza viruses contained M genes closely related to those of Eurasian avian viruses. Therefore, there may be interregional mixing of the two clades. Reassortment of shorebird M and HA genes was evident, but there was no correlation among the HA or NA subtype, M gene sequence, and isolation time. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that influenza viruses in wild waterfowl contain distinguishable lineages of M genes."

Initially, the insidious nature of the disease made it difficult to pinpoint the pathogen. The presence of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in all PMWS diseased animals led to its acceptance, possibly together with an unknown factor, as the causative agent for PMWS. Also, presence of PCV2 in healthy individuals did not facilitate the understanding of the disease. Phylogenetic classification separates PCV2 viruses into at least two major groups. With the aid of a signature motif, a short amino acid motif encoded within the capsid protein, the viruses are determined as belonging to PCV-2a or PCV-2b. Recently, this classification received more attention, as it seemed to define PCV-2b to be more virulent. This simplification, however, could not be confirmed experimentally. Hence, we investigated whether virus genetic shift was an initiator for the PMWS epizooty in Switzerland. Piglet lymphoid tissues from 1973 to 2005 were investigated by histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PCR. For genotype classification, a sequence amplificate of 137bp was used encompassing the signature motif. The onset of Swiss PMWS epizooty exhibited a marked shift in PMWS diseased and subclinically infected piglets to PCV-2b and specifically to one genotype subgroup. Complementary to these observations, healthy piglets also defined by IHC as negative are positive in the PCR reaction and are void of any PCV-2b virus during epizooty. Consequently, our data support PCV2 genome plasticity as a major contributing factor for PMWS disease manifestation."

PBV was detected in 86 of 265 (32.5%) diarrheic piglets and in 26 of 115 (22.6%) non-diarrheic piglets. All the PBV strains detected in this study belonged to genogroup I and a high proportion of PBV-positive piglets were co-infected with group A rotavirus (RVA) and bocavirus (BoV). Phylogenetic analysis of representative genogroup I strains revealed remarkably high similarity between strains; these formed a monophyletic cluster with 97-100% sequence identity in the RdRp gene. The strains were also closely related to genogroup I PBV Chinese porcine strain. The findings indicate that PBV infection is common in piglets with and without diarrhea in Northern Thailand."

AIV was detected in 222 (9.1%) of 2,441 ducks in 2007 and in 438 (17.9%) of 2,452 ducks in 2008. Prevalence of AIV peaked in late summer. We detected 27 AIV subtypes during 2007 and 31 during 2008. Ten hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes were detected each year (i.e., H1, 3-8, and 10-12 during 2007; H1-8, 10 and 11 during 2008). All neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were detected during each year of the study. Subtype diversity varied between years and increased with prevalence into September. Predominant subtypes during 2007 (comprising â¥5% of subtype diversity) included H1N1, H3N6, H3N8, H4N6, H7N3, H10N7, and H11N9. Predominant subtypes during 2008 included H3N6, H3N8, H4N6, H4N8, H6N1, and H10N7. Additionally, within each HA subtype, the same predominant HA/NA subtype combinations were detected each year and included H1N1, H3N8, H4N6, H5N2, H6N1, H7N3, H8N4, H10N7, and H11N9. The H2N3 and H12N5 viruses also predominated within the H2 and H12 subtypes, respectively, but only were detected during a single year (H2 and H12 viruses were not detected during 2007 and 2008, respectively). Mallards were the predominant species sampled (63.7% of the total), and 531 AIV were isolated from this species (80.5% of the total isolates). Mallard data collected during both years adequately described the observed temporal and spatial prevalence from the total sample and also adequately represented subtype diversity. Juvenile mallards also were adequate in describing the temporal and spatial prevalence of AIV as well as subtype diversity."

Wild birds are an important case in point, as other than influenza A virus, avian samples are rarely tested for viruses, especially in the absence of overt disease. Using bulk RNA-sequencing (""meta-transcriptomics""), we revealed the viral diversity present in Australian wild birds through the lens of the ecological factors that may determine virome structure and abundance. A meta-transcriptomic analysis of four Anseriformes (waterfowl) and Charadriiformes (shorebird) species sampled in temperate and arid Australia revealed the presence of 27 RNA virus genomes, 18 of which represent newly described species. The viruses identified included a previously described gammacoronavirus and influenza A viruses. Additionally, we identified novel virus species from the families Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Picobirnaviridae and Picornaviridae. We noted differences in virome structure that reflected underlying differences in location and influenza A infection status. Red-necked Avocets (Recurvirostra novaehollandiae) from Australia's arid interior possessed the greatest viral diversity and abundance, markedly higher than individuals sampled in temperate Australia. In Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) and dabbling ducks (Anas spp.), viral abundance and diversity were higher and more similar in hosts that were positive for influenza A infection compared to those that were negative for this virus, despite samples being collected on the same day and from the same location. This study highlights the extent and diversity of RNA viruses in wild birds and lays the foundation for understanding the factors that determine virome structure in wild populations."

Here, we report analysis of the fecal virome of house mice in residential buildings in New York City, NY. Mice were collected at seven sites in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx over a period of 1Â year. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing of feces revealed 36 viruses from 18 families and 21 genera, including at least 6 novel viruses and 3 novel genera. A representative screen of 15 viruses by PCR confirmed the presence of 13 of these viruses in liver. We identified an uneven distribution of diversity, with several viruses being associated with specific locations. Higher mouse weight was associated with an increase in the number of viruses detected per mouse, after adjusting for site, sex, and length. We found neither genetic footprints to known human viral pathogens nor antibodies to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.

            Mice carry a wide range of infectious agents with zoonotic potential. Their proximity to humans in the built environment is therefore a concern for public health. Laboratory mice are also the most common experimental model for investigating the pathobiology of infectious diseases. In this survey of mice trapped in multiple locations within New York City over a period of 1Â year, we found a diverse collection of viruses that includes some previously not associated with house mice and others that appear to be novel. Although we found no known human pathogens, our findings provide insights into viral ecology and may yield models that have utility for clinical microbiology.

The conference was accompanied by a workshop, ""Virus Spike Preparations and Virus Removal by Filtration: New Trends and Developments"". The presentations and the discussion at the workshop are summarized in a separate report that will be published in this issue of the journal as well. As with previous conferences of this series, the PDA Virus & TSE Safety Forum 2013 provided again an excellent opportunity to exchange information and opinions between the industry, research organizations, and regulatory bodies. Updates on regulatory considerations related to virus and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) safety of biopharmaceuticals were provided by agencies of the European Union (EU), the United States (US), and Singapore. The epidemiology and detection methods of new emerging pathogens like hepatitis E virus and parvovirus (PARV 4) were exemplified, and the risk of contamination of animal-derived raw materials like trypsin was considered in particular. The benefit of using new sequence-based virus detection methods was discussed. Events of bioreactor contaminations in the past drew the attention to root cause investigations and preventive actions, which were illustrated by several examples. Virus clearance data of specific unit operations were provided; the discussion focused on the mechanism of virus clearance and on the strategic concept of viral clearance integration. As in previous years, the virus safety section was followed by a TSE section that covered recent scientific findings that may influence the risk assessment of blood and cell substrates. These included the realization that interspecies transmission of TSE by blood components in sheep is greater than predicted by assays in transgenic mice. Also, the pathogenesis and possibility of productive TSE infection of cell substrates were considered, and cell-based assays that may be suitable for use in TSE clearance studies were discussed. The current report provides an overview about the outcomes of the 2013 PDA Virus & TSE Safety Forum, a unique event in this field."

Typically this testing modality enables users to order a test kit from a virtual service (via a website or app), collect their own samples, return test samples to a laboratory, and be notified of their results by short message service (SMS) or telephone. e-STI testing is assumed to increase access to testing in comparison with face-to-face services, but the evidence is unclear. We conducted a randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of an e-STI testing and results service (chlamydia, gonorrhoea, HIV, and syphilis) on STI testing uptake and STI cases diagnosed. The study took place in the London boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark. Between 24 November 2014 and 31 August 2015, we recruited 2,072 participants, aged 16-30 years, who were resident in these boroughs, had at least 1 sexual partner in the last 12 months, stated willingness to take an STI test, and had access to the internet. Those unable to provide consent and unable to read English were excluded. Participants were randomly allocated to receive 1 text message with the web link of an e-STI testing and results service (intervention group) or to receive 1 text message with the web link of a bespoke website listing the locations, contact details, and websites of 7 local sexual health clinics (control group). Participants were free to use any other services or interventions during the study period. The primary outcomes were self-reported STI testing at 6 weeks, verified by patient record checks, and self-reported STI diagnosis at 6 weeks, verified by patient record checks. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of participants prescribed treatment for an STI, time from randomisation to completion of an STI test, and time from randomisation to treatment of an STI. Participants were sent a Â£10 cash incentive on submission of self-reported data. We completed all follow-up, including patient record checks, by 17 June 2016. Uptake of STI testing was increased in the intervention group at 6 weeks (50.0% versus 26.6%, relative risk [RR] 1.87, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.15, P < 0.001). The proportion of participants diagnosed was 2.8% in the intervention group versus 1.4% in the control group (RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.70, P = 0.079). No evidence of heterogeneity was observed for any of the pre-specified subgroup analyses. The proportion of participants treated was 1.1% in the intervention group versus 0.7% in the control group (RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.71 to 4.16, P = 0.231). Time to test, was shorter in the intervention group compared to the control group (28.8 days versus 36.5 days, P < 0.001, test for difference in restricted mean survival time [RMST]), but no differences were observed for time to treatment (83.2 days versus 83.5 days, P = 0.51, test for difference in RMST). We were unable to recruit the planned 3,000 participants and therefore lacked power for the analyses of STI diagnoses and STI cases treated. The e-STI testing service increased uptake of STI testing for all groups including high-risk groups. The intervention required people to attend clinic for treatment and did not reduce time to treatment. Service innovations to improve treatment rates for those diagnosed online are required and could include e-treatment and postal treatment services. e-STI testing services require long-term monitoring and evaluation.

Distinctions between MD virus strains were further expanded with the description of the vv pathotype in the early 1980s and of the vv+ pathotype in the 1990s. Pathotype designations reflect important biological properties that correlate with the break-through of vaccinal immunity in the field. However, pathotyping methods applied by various laboratories have not been uniform, preventing critical comparison of results. Better uniformity of pathotyping procedures is desirable.The Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory (ADOL) method is based on induction of lymphoproliferative lesions in vaccinated chickens. This method has been used to pathotype more than 45 isolates and is the basis for the current pathotype classification of MD virus strains. Its limitations include requirements for a specific type of chickens (15x7 ab+), large numbers of animals, and a statistical method to compare lesion responses to those of JM/102W and Md5 control strains. Because of these limitations, it has not been and is not likely to be used in other laboratories. Comparability in pathotyping can be improved by the comparison of field isolates with standard prototype strains such as JM/102W, Md5 and 648A (American Type Culture Collection) or their equivalents. Data may be generated by different in vivo procedures that measure tumour induction, neurological disease (both neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions), or solely non-neoplastic criteria (such as lymphoid organ weights or virus replication). Methods based on neoplastic criteria, especially when generated in MD-immunized chickens, will probably correlate most closely with that of the ADOL method and be most relevant to evolution of MD virus in the field. Based on data from several trials, a modification of the ADOL method that utilizes fewer chickens and can be conducted with commercial specific pathogen free strains is proposed. The modified method is based on ""best fit"" comparisons with prototype strains, and is expected to provide results generally comparable with the original method. A variety of other alternative criteria (see earlier) are also evaluated both for primary pathotyping and as adjuncts to other pathotyping methods. Advantages and disadvantages of alternative methods are presented."

This review focuses on the potential of enteric viruses for MST applications. Following host infection, enteric viruses replicate and are excreted in high numbers in the hosts' feces and urine. Due to the specificity in host infection, enteric viruses have been considered one of the most accurate library-independent culture-independent MST tools. In an assessment of molecular viral assays based on sensitivity, specificity and the density of the target virus in fecal-impacted samples, human adenovirus and human polyomavirus were found to be the most promising human-specific viral markers. However, more research is needed to identify promising viral markers for livestock because of cross-reactions that were observed among livestock species or the limited number of samples tested for specificity. Other viral indicators of fecal origin, F+ RNA coliphage and pepper mild mottle virus, have also been proposed as potential targets for developing MST markers. Enhancing the utility of enteric viruses for MST applications through next generation sequencing (NGS) and virus concentration technology is discussed in the latter part of this review. The massive sequence databases generated by shotgun and gene-targeted metagenomics enable more efficient and reliable design of MST assays. Finally, recent studies revealed that alternative virus concentration methodologies may be more cost-effective than standard technologies such as 1MDS; however, improvements in the recovery efficiency and consistency are still needed. Overall, developments in metagenomic information combined with efficient concentration methodologies, as well as high host-specificity, make enteric viruses a promising tool in MST applications."

Taking our previous results and present data together, the entire genomic sequence of LPC strain was completed (12344 nucleotides in length). The genome of LPC has a large open reading frame that can encode a polypetide of 3897 amino acids, and are flanked by untranslated regions (UTR), 373 bases at the 5'-end and 278 bases at the 3'-end. Phylogenetic analysis based on genomic sequences of several viruses suggested that the LPC strain is closer to Chinese, Riems, HCLV, Alfort/187, Brescia, and Alfort strains in order. After further analysis, we found that an insertion of 13 nucleotides, TTT(C/T)CTTTTTTTT, in the 3'-UTR of LPC, Chinese, and HCLV strains.

Current diagnostic tools rely on isolation of the viruses, followed by serotyping by hemagglutination or genome sequencing, both of which can be expensive and time-consuming. Thus, novel subtype-specific ligands and methods are needed for rapid testing and subtyping of IAVs in the field. To address this need, we selected DNA aptamers against the recombinant HA protein from swine IAV H3 cluster IV using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Four candidate aptamers (HA68, HA7, HA2a, and HA2b) were identified and characterized. The dissociation constants (K(d)) of aptamers HA68, HA7, HA2a, and HA2b against recombinant H3 protein were 7.1, 22.3, 16.0, and 3.7 nM, respectively. The binding site of HA68 to H3 was identified to be between nucleotide residues 8 and 40. All aptamers inhibited H3 hemagglutination. HA68 was highly specific to all four lineages within the North American H3N2 subtype. Further, the other three aptamers specifically identified live viruses belonging to the phylogenetic clusters I, II/III, and IV especially the virus that closely related to the recent H3N2 variant (H3N2v). Aptamer HA68 was also able to bind and detect H3N2v isolated from recent human cases. In conclusion, we provide subtype-specific aptamers against H3N2 IAVs of swine that can now be used in rapid detection and typing protocols for field applications."

To effectively control BVDV by vaccination, it is important to know which subtypes of the virus are circulating and how their prevalence is changing over time. Accordingly, the purpose of our study was to estimate the current prevalence and diversity of BVDV subtypes from persistently infected (PI) beef calves in the central United States. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5'-UTR (5' untranslated region) for 119 virus strains revealed that a majority (82%) belonged to genotype 1b, and the remaining strains were distributed between genotypes 1a (9%) and 2 (8%); however, BVDV-2 subtypes could not be confidently resolved. Therefore, to better define the variability of U.S. BVDV isolates and further investigate the division of BVDV-2 isolates into subtypes, complete genome sequences were obtained for these isolates as well as representatives of BVDV-1a and -1b. Phylogenetic analyses of the complete coding sequence provided more conclusive genetic classification and revealed that U.S. BVDV-2 isolates belong to at least 3 distinct genetic groups that are statistically supported by both complete and individual coding gene analyses. These results show that a more complex set of BVDV-2 subtypes has been circulating in this region than was previously thought."

To estimate the potential risk, we sequentially passaged the isolate A/Hamburg/04/2009 in A549 human lung epithelial cells. After passage 6, we observed a 100-fold increased replication rate. High-throughput sequencing of viral gene segments identified five dominant mutations, whose contribution to the enhanced growth was analyzed by reverse genetics. The increased replication rate was pinpointed to two mutations within the hemagglutinin (HA) gene segment (HA1 D130E, HA2 I91L), near the receptor binding site and the stem domain. The adapted virus also replicated more efficiently in mice in vivo. Enhanced replication rate correlated with increased fusion pH of the HA protein and a decrease in receptor affinity.

H9N2 viruses are prevalent in terrestrial poultry throughout Asia and have been isolated from poultry outbreaks worldwide. They infect both avian and mammalian species and may be significant donors of genetic material to emerging human pathogens. LPMs in Zhejiang Province were surveyed from 2013-2014 for AIVs. Three hundred seventy-four (374) AIV strains were isolated from 3,328 samples. Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed. We identified a novel H9N2 virus genotype that had undergone reassortment with gene segments from Qa/HK/G1/97-like, Ck/BJ/1/94-like, and Dk/HK/Y439/97-like viruses. Phylogenetic analyses suggested the H9N2 viruses had undergone reassortments with other AIV subtypes. The results also suggested that two different clades (2.3.2 and 2.3.4.6) of H5 viruses were co-circulating in Zhejiang Province. Given that reassorted H5 AIVs were detected in geese and ducks, it is possible that apparently healthy birds contribute to emerging H5 AIVs.

Extensive regions of highly similar UTR sequences were found but small regions of divergence were also found indicating group 2 coronaviruses could be subdivided into those that are bovine coronavirus (BCoV)-like (BCoV, human respiratory coronavirus-OC43, human enteric coronavirus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, and equine coronavirus) and those that are murine hepatitis virus (MHV)-like (A59, 2, and JHM strains of MHV, puffinosis virus, and rat sialodacryoadenitis virus). The 3' UTRs of BCoV and MHV have been previously shown to be interchangeable. Here, a reporter-containing BCoV DI RNA was shown to be replicated by all five BCoV-like helper viruses and by MHV-H2 (a human cell-adapted MHV strain), a representative of the MHV-like subgroup, demonstrating group 2 common 5' and 3' replication signaling elements. BCoV DI RNA, furthermore, acquired the leader of HCoV-OC43 by leader switching, demonstrating for the first time in vivo recombination between animal and human coronavirus molecules. These results indicate that common replication signaling elements exist among group 2 coronaviruses despite a two-cluster pattern within the group and imply there could exist a high potential for recombination among group members."

Here, we collected 500 sheep sera and 75 raw sheep liver samples from a slaughterhouse in the southern part of the Xinjiang region, China, along with 26 sera of butchers from the same slaughterhouse. All serum samples were tested for anti-HEV antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Both serum and liver samples were evaluated for the presence of HEV RNA by nested polymerase chain reaction targeting partial nucleotide sequences of open reading frame 2 (ORF2). The results indicate that sheep seroprevalence was 35.20 % (176/500) and that four of the 75 (5.3 %) sheep livers showed detectable amounts of HEV RNA. The seroprevalence of the butchers was 57.7 % (15/26). The four amplicons shared 97.8-100 % nucleotide sequence identity and had pairwise sequence identities of 81.6-85.3 %, 84.2-85.3 %, 82.1-85.3 % and 84.7-97.9 % with the corresponding regions of genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 of HEV, respectively. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on alignments of an amplified 186-bp ORF2 sequence and corresponding reference strains. The analysis showed that the four sheep strains detected in our study formed a lineage within a genotype 4 cluster that contains hb-3, bjsw1, T1, swCH189 and swCH25, all of which belong to genotype 4, subtype 4d. The results indicated a high level of seroconversion in sheep and suggested that sheep liver may be a source of foodborne HEV infection in humans."

The results showed genetic diversity of these viruses: three class I viruses and one genotype I and 12 genotype II viruses of class II circulating in chickens were avirulent; four genotype VIb viruses isolated from pigeons were moderately virulent; and two genotype III viruses and 57 genotype VIId viruses were highly virulent. The three class I viruses were further classified as genotypes 2 and 3. The very high F protein sequence identity of one genotype I virus with strain Queensland V4 and 12 genotype II viruses with strain La Sota indicated that these viruses originated from the two vaccine strains. Two genotype III viruses shared greater than 99% sequence identity with the moderately virulent vaccine strain Mukteswar but exhibited significantly higher virulence, suggesting that they evolved from the vaccine virus and that the Mukteswar vaccine should be banned in China. Fifty-seven of the 63 virulent NDVs in this study belonged to genotype VIId, indicating its predominance in Eastern China. Genotype VIId viruses could be further classified into two subgroups. Four of the five NDVs isolated from pigeons belonged to genotype VIb, indicating its host-specific preference. Both the genotype VIb and VIId NDVs showed low amino acid similarity to the vaccine strains currently used in China, implying the urgent need to develop better vaccines against the most prevalent NDVs in China."

The causative agents of ND are virulent strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), which are members of the genus Avulavirus within the family Paramyxoviridae. Waterfowl, such as ducks and geese, are generally considered potential reservoirs of NDV and may show few or no clinical signs when infected with viruses that are obviously virulent in chickens. However, ND outbreaks in domestic waterfowl have been frequently reported in many countries in the past decade. In this study, 18 NDV strains isolated from domestic ducks in southern and eastern China, between 2005 and 2013, were genetically and phylogenetically characterized. The complete genomes of these strains were sequenced, and they exhibited genome sizes of 15,186 nucleotides (nt), 15,192 nt, and 15,198 nt, which follow the ""rule of six"" that is required for the replication of NDV strains. Based on the cleavage site of the F protein and pathogenicity tests in chickens, 17 of our NDV isolates were categorized as lentogenic viruses, and one was characterized as a velogenic virus. Phylogenetic analysis based on the partial sequences of the F gene and the complete genome sequences showed that there are at least four genotypes of NDV circulating in domestic ducks; GD1, AH224, and AH209 belong to genotypes VIId, Ib, and II of class II NDVs, respectively, and the remaining 15 isolates belong to genotype 1b of class I NDVs. Cross-reactive hemagglutination inhibition tests demonstrated that the antigenic relatedness between NDV strains may be associated with their genotypes, rather than their hosts. These results suggest that though those NDV isolates were from duck, they still don't form a phylogenetic group because they came from the same species; however, they may play an important role in promoting the evolution of NDVs."

The Chinese virulent (CHv) and attenuate vaccines (VAC) are two different pathogenic DEV strains. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in viral infection. Nonetheless, there is little information on virulent duck enteritis virus (DEV)-encoded miRNAs. Using high-throughput sequencing, we identified 39 mature viral miRNAs from CHv-infected duck embryo fibroblasts cells. Compared with the reported 33 VAC-encoded miRNAs, only 13 miRNA sequences and 22 ""seed sequences"" of miRNA were identical, and 8 novel viral miRNAs were detected and confirmed by stem-loop RT-qPCR in this study. Using RNAhybrid and PITA software, 38 CHv-encoded miRNAs were predicted to target 41 viral genes and formed a complex regulatory network. Dual luciferase reporter assay (DLRA) confirmed that viral dev-miR-D8-3p can directly target the 3'-UTR of CHv US1 gene (pâ<â0.05). Gene Ontology analysis on host target genes of viral miRNAs were mainly involved in biological regulation, cellular and metabolic processes. In addition, 598 novel duck-encoded miRNAs were detected in this study. Thirty-eight host miRNAs showed significant differential expression after CHv infection: 13 miRNAs were up-regulated, and 25 miRNAs were down-regulated, which may affect viral replication in the host cell. These data suggested that CHv encoded a different set of microRNAs and formed a unique regulatory network compared with VAC. This is the first report of DEF miRNAs expression profile and an analysis of these miRNAs regulatory mechanisms during DEV infection. These data provide a basis for further exploring miRNA regulatory roles in the pathogenesis of DEV infection and contribute to the understanding of the CHv-host interaction at the miRNA level."

Weekly surveillance of H9N2-subtype AIVs in the air of LPMs was conducted from 2015 to 2016. H9-positive samples were isolated from chicken embryos. Whole genome sequences of the isolated AIVs were obtained through high-throughput sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis and key loci variations of the sequences were further analyzed. A total of 327 aerosol samples were collected from LPMs. Nine samples were positive for H9-subtype AIVs based on quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRRT-PCR). According to the whole genome sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis, except for the A/Environment/Zhongshan/ZS201505/2015 (ZS201505) strain, 8 gene segments of 8 aerosol H9N2 isolates and 2 H9N2 human isolates in 2015 were located in the same clade.

The PA gene of ZS201503 and ZS201602 exhibited an L336M mutation. The N30D and T215A mutations in the M1 gene and amino acid residues L89V in PB2, P42S in NS1 and S31N in M2 were retained in these 9 strains of H9N2 isolates, which could enhance the virus's virulence. Live H9N2 AIVs survived in the aerosol of LPMs in Zhongshan City. The aerosol viruses had a close evolutionary relationship with human epidemic strains, indicating that there might be a risk of AIV transmission from polluted aerosols in LPMs to humans. Mutations in H9N2-subtype AIVs isolated from air samples collected from LPMs suggested their pathogenicity was enhanced to infect humans."

The data obtained in this study revealed an overview of the viral community present in these bat samples. Many novel bat viruses were reported for the first time and some bat viruses closely related to known human or animal pathogens were identified. This genetic evidence provides new clues in the search for the origin or evolution pattern of certain viruses, such as coronaviruses and noroviruses. These data offer meaningful ecological information for predicting and tracing wildlife-originated EIDs."

Pairwise alignments and phylogenetic analyses indicated that these novel viruses showed little genetic similarity with previously reported viruses. This study also revealed a high prevalence and diversity of bat astroviruses and coronaviruses in some provinces. These findings have expanded our understanding of the viromes of bats in China and hinted at the presence of a large variety of unknown mammalian viruses in many common bat species of mainland China.

It is culture independent, requires no a priori knowledge of the viruses in the sample, and may provide useful genomic information. However, MSS can lack sensitivity and may yield insufficient data for detailed analysis. We have created a targeted sequence capture panel, ViroCap, designed to enrich nucleic acid from DNA and RNA viruses from 34 families that infect vertebrate hosts. A computational approach condensed â¼1 billion bp of viral reference sequence into &lt;200 million bp of unique, representative sequence suitable for targeted sequence capture. We compared the effectiveness of detecting viruses in standard MSS versus MSS following targeted sequence capture. First, we analyzed two sets of samples, one derived from samples submitted to a diagnostic virology laboratory and one derived from samples collected in a study of fever in children. We detected 14 and 18 viruses in the two sets, comprising 19 genera from 10 families, with dramatic enhancement of genome representation following capture enrichment. The median fold-increases in percentage viral reads post-capture were 674 and 296. Median breadth of coverage increased from 2.1% to 83.2% post-capture in the first set and from 2.0% to 75.6% in the second set. Next, we analyzed samples containing a set of diverse anellovirus sequences and demonstrated that ViroCap could be used to detect viral sequences with up to 58% variation from the references used to select capture probes. ViroCap substantially enhances MSS for a comprehensive set of viruses and has utility for research and clinical applications.</jats:p>"

Despite considerable research efforts, the molecular events following Ebola virus (EBOV) infection are poorly understood. With the view of identifying host factors that underpin EBOV pathogenesis, we compared the transcriptomes of EBOV-infected human, pig, and bat kidney cells using a transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) approach. Despite a significant difference in viral transcription/replication between the cell lines, all cells responded to EBOV infection through a robust induction of extracellular growth factors. Furthermore, a significant upregulation of activator protein 1 (AP1) transcription factor complex members

            was observed in permissive cell lines. Functional studies focusing on human cells showed that EBOV infection induces protein expression, phosphorylation, and nuclear accumulation of JUN and, to a lesser degree, FOS. Using a luciferase-based reporter, we show that EBOV infection induces AP1 transactivation activity within human cells at 48 and 72 h postinfection. Finally, we show that JUN knockdown decreases the expression of EBOV-induced host gene expression. Taken together, our study highlights the role of AP1 in promoting the host gene expression profile that defines EBOV pathogenesis.

            Many questions remain about the molecular events that underpin filovirus pathophysiology. The rational design of new intervention strategies, such as postexposure therapeutics, will be significantly enhanced through an in-depth understanding of these molecular events. We believe that new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of EBOV may be possible by examining the transcriptomic response of taxonomically diverse cell lines (derived from human, pig, and bat). We first identified the responsive pathways using an RNA-seq-based transcriptomics approach. Further functional and computational analysis focusing on human cells highlighted an important role for the AP1 transcription factor in mediating the transcriptional response to EBOV infection. Our study sheds new light on how host transcription factors respond to and promote the transcriptional landscape that follows viral infection.

Traditionally, inferring BVDV phylogeny has been performed by distance-based method, i.e. neighbor-joining for single genes. In this study, a Bayesian approach was exploited to analyze five genetic regions of BVDV genome (5' UTR, N(pro), E2a, E2b, and NS3) for 68 taxa retrieved from GenBank. The results showed that all taxa in the consensus tree of E2a have been assigned correctly to corresponding groups, i.e. type-2 BVDV, and BVDV-1a, -1b, -1c, -1e, and -1g, supported by a high posterior probability. In contrast, subgroup 1a formed polytomies in the consensus trees of 5' UTR and NS3. Polytomies also appeared among the subgroup 1b in the consensus trees of N(pro) and E2b. Analysis of a combined dataset produced an unambiguous, well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis. The topologies found for each genetic region separately and combined were different, but the differences were mainly weakly supported by the data. Combining the data allowed the identification of well-supported clades of strains that correspond to some of the previously defined subgroups. Only a combined approach will allow the confident placement of new strains in the current classification of viruses into genotype and subgenotype."

While PPR mainly affects domestic goats and sheep, it also affects wild ungulates such as ibex, blue sheep, and gazelle, although there are few reports regarding PPRV infection in wild animals. Between January 2015 and February 2015, it was found for the first time that wild ibexes died from PPRV infection in Bazhou, Xinjiang, China, where a total of 38 ibexes (including young and adult ibexes) were found to have died abnormally from PPR-related issues. First, we tested for the presence of the F gene of PPRV by RT-PCR. Then, we compared the sequence of the isolated F gene from the ibex strain, termed PPRV Xinjiang/Ibex/2015, with those previously identified from small domestic ruminants from local areas near where the reported isolate was collected as well as those from other regions. The current sequence was phylogenetically classified as a lineage IV virus, and shared a high level of sequence identity (99.7%) with a previously described Xinjiang PPRV isolate."

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is infectious for at least 250 bird species, but the role of wild birds in virus epidemiology remains largely unknown. Fourteen NDV isolates were obtained from 2040 samples collected from wild birds or the environment in Guangdong province, southern China, from 2013 to 2015. The isolation rate was the highest in the period of wintering and lowest during the periods of spring migration, nesting, and postnesting. A maximum clade credibility phylogenetic analysis revealed that at least four genotypes circulate in southern China: three class II genotypes (II, VI, and IX) and one class I (1b). We also demonstrated that most isolates from wild birds were highly similar to isolates from poultry, and two isolates were linked to viruses from wild birds in northern China. These data suggested that wild birds could disseminate NDV and poultry-derived viruses may spillover to wild birds. Accordingly, vaccine development and poultry management strategies should be considered to prevent future NDV outbreaks, particularly given the strength of the poultry industry in developing countries, such as China."

To investigate the presence and prevalence of PPV2 in the USA, a novel TaqMan(Â®) real-time PCR method was developed and used for a PPV2 survey using 483 lung samples, 185 fecal samples and 122 sera collected from pigs on 295 farms in 18 U.S. states. The overall prevalence of PPV2 was 20.7% (100/483) in lung samples and 7.6% (14/185) in fecal samples obtained from pigs of different age groups, and 1.6% (2/122) in sera or thoracic fluids obtained from neonatal pigs. Further genomic sequence comparison demonstrated that the 2011 U.S. PPV2 sequences have nucleotide identities of 95.4-97.7% with the 2006-2007 strains detected in China while the nucleotide identity was 94.7% with the 2001 strain detected in Myanmar, indicating persistent evolution of the virus. Phylogenetic and sequence homology analyses demonstrated a close relationship of PPV2 with members of the proposed genus PARV4-like virus, and the classification of PPV2 into this proposed genus is suggested."

Due to the advent of new sequence-independent PCR methods and high-throughput sequencing, several novel members of parvoviruses within the subfamily Parvovirinae were recently described. Several of these viruses do not fit in the current classification and others now have confusing or contradictory nomenclature because two or more names were used for similar or identical groups of parvoviruses or identical names were used for distinct virus groups. In this study, recently described vertebrate parvoviruses with emphasis on those identified in pigs were classified through phylogenetic analyses based on the sequences of their complete or near complete genomes, open reading frame (ORF) 1 (non-structural protein, NS1), ORF2 (capsid protein, VP1), and ORF3 (nuclear phosphoprotein, NP1) genes by using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Neighbor-Joining (NJ) methods. Among all available vertebrate parvovirus sequences, eight distinct clades were identified, corresponding to the five well established genera Parvovirus, Erythrovirus, Denpendovirus, Amdovirus and Bocavirus. Moreover, three novel clades were identified and tentatively designated as PARV4-like virus, novel clade 1 and novel clade 2. Parvoviruses in pigs were found to be distributed across four different clades including Parvovirus, Bocavirus, PARV4-like virus and the novel clade 2. All pig parvoviruses identified to date were organized based on the current analysis. The present analysis will assist to clarify the nomenclature of parvoviruses in pigs and facilitate future uniform assignment of names for new parvoviruses within the subfamily Parvovirinae."

We subjected bovine genomic DNA to PCR with degenerate or ovine ERV (OERV) family-specific primers that aimed to amplify the retroviral pro/pol region. Sequence analysis of 113 clones obtained by PCR revealed that 69 were of retroviral origin. On the basis of the OERV classification system, these clones from degenerate PCR could be divided into the beta3, gamma4, and gamma9 families. PCR with OERV family-specific primers revealed an additional ERV that was classified into the bovine endogenous retrovirus (BERV) gamma7 family. In conclusion, here we report the results of a genome scale study of the BERV. Our study shows that the ERV family expansion in cattle may be somewhat limited, while more diverse family members of ERVs have been reported from other artiodactyls, such as pigs and sheep."

PRRS virus (PRRSV) replicates mainly in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and dendritic cells (DCs) and develops persistent infections, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), interstitial pneumonia and immunosuppression. But the molecular mechanisms of PRRSV infection still are poorly understood. Here we report on the first genome-wide host transcriptional responses to classical North American type PRRSV (N-PRRSV) strain CH 1a infection using Solexa/Illumina's digital gene expression (DGE) system, a tag-based high-throughput transcriptome sequencing method, and analyse systematically the relationship between pulmonary gene expression profiles after N-PRRSV infection and infection pathology. Our results suggest that N-PRRSV appeared to utilize multiple strategies for its replication and spread in infected pigs, including subverting host innate immune response, inducing an anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory state as well as developing ADE. Upregulation expression of virus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and inflammatory enzymes and inflammatory cells, antibodies, complement activation were likely to result in the development of inflammatory responses during N-PRRSV infection processes. N-PRRSV-induced immunosuppression might be mediated by apoptosis of infected cells, which caused depletion of immune cells and induced an anti-inflammatory cytokine response in which they were unable to eradicate the primary infection. Our systems analysis will benefit for better understanding the molecular pathogenesis of N-PRRSV infection, developing novel antiviral therapies and identifying genetic components for swine resistance/susceptibility to PRRS."

The mechanisms underlying the molecular pathogenesis of the highly virulent PRRS virus (H-PRRSV) remains unknown. Therefore, the relationship between pulmonary gene expression profiles after H-PRRSV infection and infection pathology were analyzed in this study using high-throughput deep sequencing and histopathology. H-PRRSV infection resulted in severe lung pathology. The results indicate that aberrant host innate immune responses to H-PRRSV and induction of an anti-apoptotic state could be responsible for the aggressive replication and dissemination of H-PRRSV. Prolific rapid replication of H-PRRSV could have triggered aberrant sustained expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines leading to a markedly robust inflammatory response compounded by significant cell death and increased oxidative damage. The end result was severe tissue damage and high pathogenicity. The systems analysis utilized in this study provides a comprehensive basis for better understanding the pathogenesis of H-PRRSV. Furthermore, it allows the genetic components involved in H-PRRSV resistance/susceptibility in swine populations to be identified."

Although NDV vaccines exist, there are frequent reports of outbreaks in vaccinated chickens. During 2009-2010, despite intense vaccination, NDV caused major outbreaks among commercial poultry farms in Indonesia. These outbreaks raised concern regarding the protective immunity of current vaccines against circulating virulent strains in Indonesia. In this study, we investigated whether a recombinant attenuated Indonesian NDV strain could provide better protection against prevalent Indonesian viruses. A reverse genetics system for the highly virulent NDV strain Banjarmasin/010/10 (Ban/010) isolated in Indonesia in 2010 was constructed. The Ban/010 virus is classified in genotype VII of class II NDV, which is genetically distinct from the commercial vaccine strains B1 and LaSota, which belong to genotype II, and shares only 89 and 87% amino acid identity for the protective antigens F and HN, respectively. A mutant virus, named Ban/AF, was developed in which the virulent F protein cleavage site motif ""RRQKRâF"" was modified to an avirulent motif ""GRQGRâL"" by three amino acid substitutions (underlined). The Ban/AF vaccine virus did not produce syncytia or plaques in cell culture, even in the presence of added protease. Pathogenicity tests showed that Ban/AF was completely avirulent. Ban/AF replicated efficiently during 10 consecutive passages in chickens and remained genetically stable. Serological analysis showed that Ban/AF induced higher neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers against the prevalent viruses than the commercial vaccines B1 or LaSota. Both Ban/AF and commercial vaccines provided protection against clinical disease and mortality after challenge with virulent NDV strain Ban/010 (genotype VII) or GB Texas (genotype II). However, Ban/AF significantly reduced challenge virus shedding from the vaccinated birds compared to B1 vaccine. These results suggest that Ban/AF can provide better protection than commercial vaccines and is a promising vaccine candidate against NDV strains circulating in Indonesia."

Seven PPV genotypes (PPV1 to PPV7) have been identified to date. PPV7, the most recently discovered PPV genotype, was first reported in US pigs in 2016. To explore PPV7 status in Chinese pig populations a total of 64 serum samples collected from two commercial farms in Guangdong province in 2014 were analyzed. PPV7 DNA was detected in 32.8% (21/64) of tested samples. On the porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) positive farm, the prevalence rate of PPV7 was 65.5% (19/29) which was significantly higher than that on the PCV2 negative farm (2/35, 5.7%), indicating a possible association between PCV2 and PPV7 infections. The sequences of three PPV7 strains were determined. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the identified PPV7 strains circulating in China shared 98.7%-99.7% nucleotide homology with the US strain. Further sequence comparison analysis indicated that GD-2014-2 and GD-2014-3 possess a consecutive 9-nt deletion in the VP gene. This is the first report of the existence of PPV7 in China and this finding will strengthen understanding of the epidemiology of porcine parvovirus in Chinese pigs."

In this study, we detected and genetically characterized porcine bocavirus (PBoV) carried by murine rodents (Rattus norvegicus, Rattus tanezumi, and Rattus losea) and house shrews (Suncus murinus) in China. Between May 2015 and May 2017, 496 murine rodents and 23 house shrews were captured in four Chinese provinces. Nested polymerase chain reaction was used to investigate the prevalence of PBoV in throat swab, faecal and serum samples. A total of 7.5% (39/519) throat swab samples, 60.5% (309/511) faecal samples, and 22.9% (52/227) serum samples were PBoV-positive. The prevalence among R.Â norvegicus and R.Â tanezumi was higher than that among R.Â losea and house shrews. PBoV-positive samples were found in all four provinces. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial viral capsid protein 1/2 (VP1/VP2) showed that sequences obtained in this study formed a novel group (PBoV G4). In addition, five near full-length PBoV genomes (4,715-4,798Â nt) were acquired. These genomes encoded two non-structural proteins, NS1 (1,908Â nt in four genomes and 1,923Â nt in the remaining genome) and NP1 (600Â nt), and the structural proteins, VP1/VP2 (1,851Â nt). Phylogenetic analysis showed that PBoV G4 is distinct from rodent, human, and other bocaviruses. In conclusion, PBoV G4 prevalence was high among two common murine rodents in China, and the pathogenecity of PBoV G4 need to be further clarified."

Although the importance of gut microbiota of humans has been well demonstrated, there is a paucity of research regarding non-human primates (NHPs), especially herbivorous NHPs. In this study, an analysis of 97,942 pyrosequencing reads generated from Rhinopithecus bieti fecal DNA extracts was performed to help better understanding of the microbial diversity and functional capacity of the R. bieti gut microbiome. The taxonomic analysis of the metagenomic reads indicated that R. bieti fecal microbiomes were dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria phyla. The comparative analysis of taxonomic classification revealed that the metagenome of R. bieti was characterized by an overrepresentation of bacteria of phylum Fibrobacteres and Spirochaetes as compared with other animals. Primary functional categories were associated mainly with protein, carbohydrates, amino acids, DNA and RNA metabolism, cofactors, cell wall and capsule and membrane transport. Comparing glycoside hydrolase profiles of R. bieti with those of other animal revealed that the R. bieti microbiome was most closely related to cow rumen. Metagenomic and functional analysis demonstrated that R. bieti possesses a broad diversity of bacteria and numerous glycoside hydrolases responsible for lignocellulosic biomass degradation which might reflect the adaptations associated with a diet rich in fibrous matter. These results would contribute to the limited body of NHPs metagenome studies and provide a unique genetic resource of plant cell wall degrading microbial enzymes. However, future studies on the metagenome sequencing of R. bieti regarding the effects of age, genetics, diet and environment on the composition and activity of the metagenomes are required."

We discovered a 3,780-bp contig present in all 10 pools that yielded BLASTx E scores of 7e-05â0.008 against parvoviruses. The complete sequence of the
            <jats:italic>in silico</jats:italic>

Further analysis revealed that the contig was composed of two major ORFs. By protein BLAST, ORF1 and ORF2 were most homologous to the replication-associated protein of bat circovirus and the capsid protein of porcine parvovirus, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that NIH-CQV is located at the interface of

Average virus titer in the patient specimens was 1.05 e4 copies/ÂµL. Specific antibodies against NIH-CQV were sought by immunoblotting. Eighty-four percent of patients were positive for IgG, and 31% were positive for IgM; in contrast, 78% of healthy controls were positive for IgG, but all were negative for IgM. Although more work is needed to determine the etiologic role of NIH-CQV in human disease, our data indicate that a parvovirus-like virus is highly prevalent in a cohort of patients with non-AâE hepatitis.

An important regulatory protein of HEV, ORF3, influences multiple signal pathways in host cells. In this study, to investigate the function of ORF3 from the swine form of HEV (SHEV), high-throughput RNA-Seq-based screening was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes in ORF3-expressing HepG2 cells. The results were validated with quantitative real-time PCR and gene ontology was employed to assign differentially expressed genes to functional categories. The results indicated that, in the established ORF3-expressing HepG2 cells, the mRNA levels of CLDN6, YLPM1, APOC3, NLRP1, SCARA3, FGA, FGG, FGB, and FREM1 were upregulated, whereas the mRNA levels of SLC2A3, DKK1, BPIFB2, and PTGR1 were downregulated. The deregulated expression of CLDN6 and FREM1 might contribute to changes in integral membrane protein and basement membrane protein expression, expression changes for NLRP1 might affect the apoptosis of HepG2 cells, and the altered expression of APOC3, SCARA3, and DKK1 may affect lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, ORF3 plays a functional role in virus-cell interactions by affecting the expression of integral membrane protein and basement membrane proteins and by altering the process of apoptosis and lipid metabolism in host cells. These findings provide important insight into the pathogenic mechanism of HEV."

In this study, we reported a novel triple-reassortant H1N1 virus (A/swine/Guangdong/1/2010) containing genes from the classical swine (NP, NS), human (PB1) and avian (HA, NA, M, PB2, PA) lineages, which was for the first time reported in China. Also, phylogenetic analysis further confirmed that five genes segments (NS, NP, PB2, PB1, PA) of the isolate were closely related to the novel reassortant H1N2 viruses isolated in China in 2006, while the other three (HA, NA, M) were closely related to avian-like H1N1 viruses in China. The isolation of triple-reassortant H1N1 influenza virus provides further evidence that pigs serve as emergence hosts or ""mixing vessels"", and swine influenza virus (SIV) surveillance in China should be given a high priority."

The VP2 gene sequences of nine newly isolated IBDVs, obtained using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, were determined and compared with worldwide reference isolates, which have been previously well characterized. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the nine broiler IBDV isolates are closely related to very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV) strains. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences of VP2 from the nine vvIBDVs isolated from the broilers revealed that they share 99.2 to 100% sequence similarity. Additionally, amino acids A222, I242, I256, I294 and S299 of VP2 that are conserved among previously characterized vvIBDV strains are also encoded by the nine isolates. This study confirms the circulation of vvIBDVs in Chinese broiler chicken farms experienced slow evolution and was relatively stable in China."

Control measures included movement restrictions that were placed on a total of 404 individual premises, 150 of which were located within a 3âkm radius of an infected premise(s) (IP). A complete epidemiological investigation revealed that the source of this HPAI H5N2 virus for 4 of the commercial IPs and the single non-commercial IP likely involved indirect contact with wild birds. Three IPs were associated with the movement of birds or service providers and localized/environmental spread was suspected as the source of infection for the remaining 4 IPs. Viral phylogenies, as determined by Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood methods, were used to validate the epidemiologically inferred transmission network. The phylogenetic clustering of concatenated viral genomes and the median-joining phylogenetic network of the viruses supported, for the most part, the transmission network that was inferred by the epidemiologic analysis."

Two H9N2 viruses were isolated from one mink farm in 2014. Phylogenetic analysis showed that internal genes of the H9N2 viruses have close relationship with those of H7N9 viruses. Interestingly, two H9N2 were separated in phylogenetic trees, indicating that they are introduced to this mink farm in two independent events. And further mice studies showed that one H9N2 caused obvious weight loss and 20% mortality in infected mice, while another virus did not cause any clinical sign in mice infected at the same dose. Genetic analysis indicated that the virulent H9N2 contain a natural mutation at 701N in PB2 protein, which was reported to contribute to mammalian adaptation. However, such substitution is absent in the H9N2 avirulent to mice. Circulation of H9N2 in mink may drive the virus to adapt mammals; continual surveillance of influenza virus in mink was warranted."

The present study was an attempt to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship of H9N2 AIVs in two geographically distinct regions of China where vaccination is routinely practiced. A total of 18 emerging H9N2 isolates were identified and genetically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes confirmed that the isolates belonged to the Y280 lineage. Based on the HA genes, the isolates were subdivided into two subgroups. The viruses from Zhejiang Province were clustered together in Group I, while the isolates from Guangdong Province were clustered together in Group II. Antigenic characterization showed that the tested viruses were antigenically different when compared to the current used vaccine strain. It was notable that 14 out of total 18 isolates had an amino acid exchange (QâL) at position 216 (226 by H3 Numbering) in the receptor-binding site, which indicated that the virus had potential affinity of binding to human like receptor. These results suggest that the emerging viruses have potential risk to public health than previously thought. Therefore, continuous surveillance studies of H9N2 influenza virus are very important to the prognosis and control of future influenza pandemics."

Twenty-six of the 31 isolates were classified as BVDV1 and the remainder as BVDV2. Phylogenetic analysis of the RT-PCR fragments amplified from the isolates showed the presence of viruses belonging to the BVDV1a, BVDV1b, BVDV1c, unclassified BVDV1 genotypes, and BVDV2. From the cattle of Australian origin, 16 of 17 isolates were classified as BVDV1c. This result was in agreement with a report showing that BVDV1c was a predominant subgenotype in Australia. From the cattle of North American origin, BVDV1 and BVDV2 species were both found. BVDV2 from the North American cattle was identified as the same cluster as the BVDV 890 strain, which is the prototype of BVDV2. These results suggest that the BVDVs isolated from exported cattle at the AQS reflect the predominant genotypes of BVDVs found in the exporting countries. The unclassified BVDV1 genotype of Chinese origin was in the same cluster as the ZM-95 strain, which was isolated from pigs in China. In this study, the genomic properties of 31 isolates of BVDV collected in the AQS were investigated. We concluded that isolates are genetically heterogeneous but geographically restricted. The information obtained from this report will be useful when carrying out epidemiological surveys of BVDV isolated in Japan."

However, the characteristics of domestic infections of hepatitis E in Japan are not fully understood. We analyzed serum samples from 34 patients who were seen at a city hospital in Sendai, Japan, between January 1997 and December 2002, and who had been given the diagnosis of sporadic acute hepatitis of non-A, non-B, non-C etiology. Among these 34 patients, 3 (9%; all men; aged 54, 59, and 61 years) were positive for both IgG and IgM anti-HEV antibodies and for HEV RNA. The HEV isolates (HE-JAS1 and HE-JAS3) obtained from case 1 and case 3, respectively, segregated into genotype III; they had the highest nucleotide sequence identity, of 99.5% and 99.0%, with HE-JA7 and HE-JA8, respectively, both of which had been isolated in Iwate, a neighboring prefecture of Sendai. In contrast, the remaining HEV isolate (HE-JAS2), obtained from case 2, segregated into genotype IV; it had the highest nucleotide sequence identity, of 99.8% and 99.3%, with JKK-Sap and HE-JA3, respectively, both of which had been isolated in Hokkaido, Japan, although case 2 had never been to Hokkaido. Our three patients with hepatitis E had not traveled abroad in the preceding 1 year, had had no contact with pigs, and no history of blood transfusion. These results indicate that HEV should be considered as an etiological agent of acute hepatitis of non-A, non-B, non-C etiology in Japan. The risk factor(s) for acquiring domestic HEV infection in Japan needs to be clarified in future studies."

Immunized sentinel chickens with high levels of neutralizing antibodies and non-immunized sentinel chickens were raised together with broiler chickens in a commercial farm. Severe atrophy of the bursa of Fabricius was observed from the second week after cohabitation in non-immunized sentinel chickens. However, in immunized sentinel chickens and broiler chickens, atrophy was observed from the third week after cohabitation. The IBD virus (IBDV) isolated from the bursa of Fabricius of immunized sentinel chickens, designated as strain IBDV TY2, showed severe atrophy of the bursa in infected SPF chickens. Antiserum to the IBDV TY2 strain showed higher neutralizing activity to heterologous IBDV strains than did antiserum to the K strain vaccine virus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the nucleotide sequences encoding the hypervariable region of virus protein 2 of the IBDV TY2 strain did not cluster with the classical, variant or very virulent IBDV groups. Based on these results, we suggest that the IBDV TY2 strain may constitute a novel variant type of IBDV."

The pathogenic characters of seven IBV strains were assessed. Each of the seven strains was infective to the test chickens and could induce an immune response. The results from chicken embryo cross-neutralization assays showed that these strains were antigenically distinct from classic IBV strains of H120, M41, Conn, and Gray. Compared to H120 vaccine strain, point mutation, short insertion, and deletion occurred at many positions in the S1 protein of the seven strains. Five of the seven strains had the motif (HRRRR), which was identical to that of the epidemic IBV strains in China. Two new motifs (HRLRR and RRIRR) emerged in the isolated strains. The homology of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the S1 gene among the seven isolates was 81.7%-99.7% and 79.0%-99.4%, respectively. These seven strains were also genetically different from the vaccine strains and non-China IBV strains but closely related to large numbers of Chinese strains. The seven isolates and 36 reference IBV strains were clustered into six distinct groups (I-VI). The seven strains were categorized into groups I, II, and III, forming a big phylogenetic branch, which is closely related to Chinese IBVs, whereas the vaccine strains belonging to group VI are genetically distant from groups I, II, and III. The results from this study indicate that different IBV strains cocirculate in the chicken population in China."

In the present study, the carcass of a beef breed cow and tissue samples of a beef calf were received for laboratory diagnosis. Both animals exhibited severe clinical signs compatible with thrombocytopenia or hemorrhagic syndrome. Direct fluorescent antibody test (DFAT) failed to detect BVDV antigen in the tissue specimens of both cases. However, immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed the presence of BVDV antigen in oral and esophageal mucosa and Peyer patches of the beef breed cow. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) detected BVDV-2 in selected tissues of both animals. Subsequently, BVDV was isolated from both cases and subjected to genetic and serologic characterizations. Mutations in the 5'-untranslated genomic region (5'-UTR) primer and probe binding sites and the E2 gene were associated with reduced efficiency of an established real-time RT-PCR assay and amino acid alterations in the E2 glycoprotein, respectively. Both viral isolates were classified by real-time RT-PCR and phylogenetic analysis as BVDV-2 subgenotype a. Unlike BVDV reference strains Singer and 125c, the isolates cross-reacted with anti-BVDV-1 and anti-BVDV-2 reference sera, indicating antigenic variations in field isolates. The isolates also showed reduced reactivity to porcine anti-BVDV antiserum (the raw serum used to produce BVDV DFA conjugate). In summary, data from the present investigation indicated that genetic and antigenic variations affected the performance of detection assays, especially DFAT, highlighting the need for regular evaluation and modification of BVDV tests."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a class of crucial regulators for gene expression and are involved in the regulation of virus defence and immunological processes. To understand miRNA regulation in chickens in response to IBV infection, high-throughput sequencing was performed to compare the small RNA libraries from the kidneys of chicken infected with SCK2, SCDY2 and LDT3-A. By comparing these data to healthy chickens, a total of 58 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were identified. The DE miRNAs were further classified into five miRNA expression patterns (up or down regulation compared to control). Using Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment prediction, the DE miRNAs were shown to be mostly associated with metabolic processes, catalytic activities, gene expression, binding activities and immune responses. Seven highly expressed miRNAs (gga-miR-30d, gga-miR-1454, gga-miR-7b, gga-miR-215-5p, gga-miR-1a-3p, gga-miR-3538 and gga-miR-2954) were selected for miRNA-mRNA conjoint analysis. Furthermore, the miRNAs inversely correlated with the corresponding target gene mRNAs. These seven miRNAs were considered to play an important role in IBV-host interactions and the differing virulence of IBV strains. This is the first demonstration that infection with different virulent IBVs elicits different expression of miRNAs in chicken kidneys; this expression also seems to be associated with the virulence of IBV. These results are significant for the study of immune responses to infection with different virulent IBVs mediated by miRNAs as well as the interaction between the chicken host and IBV."

This virus poses a significant potential threat to humans and poultry due to its global dissemination and infectiousness. We used three overlapping polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) to map the whole genome of AGV2. We then modelled the evolutionary history of these novel sequence data in the context of related sequences from GenBank. We analysed the viral protein characteristics of the different phylogenetic groups and explored differences in evolutionary trends between Chinese strains and strains from other countries. We obtained 17 avian-sourced AGV2 whole genomes from different regions of China from 2015 to 2016. Phylogenetic analyses of these Chinese AGV2 sequences and related sequences produced four distinct groups (A-D) with significant bootstrap values. We also built phylogenies using predicted viral protein sequences. We found a potential hypervariable region in VP1 at sites 288-314, and we identified the amino acid changes responsible for the distinct VP2 and VP3 groups. Three new motifs in the AGV2 5'-UTR direct repeat (DR) region were discovered and grouped. The novel characteristics and diverse research on the AGV2 genome provide a valuable framework for additional research."

However, ZZ2004, a Chinese isolate of IBV, was obtained from ducks with clinical growth suppression and mild respiratory symptoms that had been reared with chickens in the central region of China. Virus isolation, virus neutralization testing, and RT-PCR were employed to identify the causative pathogen, while sequence alignment was used to analyze gene variations of the S1 subunit and M genes. The results showed that the ducks were infected with IBV due to the emergence of a dwarfing phenotype and the death of embryos between 48 and 144Â h post-inoculation. RT-PCR also confirmed the presence of the expected fragment sizes of the S1 subunit and M genes by RT-PCR. Meanwhile, the results of the virus neutralization test indicated that the strains of JX/99/01, GD, SAIBK, LDT3 showed cross-reactivity with the ZZ2004 isolate, and hardly any cross-neutralization of IBV ZZ2004 was observed with the strains of M41, H120, Gray, Holte, or Aust-T. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that there were large differences between ZZ2004 and other IBV reference strains on the S1 subunit. Meanwhile, homologies in the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the M gene of IBV ZZ2004 were 86.9-92.0Â % and 91.1-93.9Â %, respectively, compared with 35 other IBV reference strains derived from different regions. This result revealed that there were conspicuous variations among the selected strains. Furthermore, the results showed that the prevalent strains of IBV in ducks had no antigen homology with the vaccine strains widely used in ChinaÂ except the LDT3-strain, making it urgent to explore and develop new IBV vaccines."

The genetic basis of its pathogenesis remains enigmatic, and no effective prevention measures have been established. To better understand the virulence differentiation of S. suis and develop a promising vaccine, we isolated and sequenced a native avirulent S. suis strain (05HAS68). Animal experiments revealed that 05HAS68 is an avirulent strain and could protect piglets from the attack of virulent strains. Comparative genomics analyses demonstrated the genetic basis for the lack of virulence in 05HAS68, which is characterized by the absence of some important virulence-associated factors and the intact 89K pathogenicity island. Lack of virulence was also illustrated by reduced survival of 05HAS68 compared to a virulent strain in pig whole blood. Further investigations revealed a large-scale genomic rearrangement in 05HAS68, which was proposed to be mediated by transposase genes and/or prophages. This genomic rearrangement may have caused the genomic diversity of S. suis, and resulted in biological discrepancies between 05HAS68 and highly virulent S. suis strains."

It has been suggested that the virus can bind to both 2,3- and 2,6-linked sialic acid receptors in infected mammals, in contrast to contemporary seasonal H1N1 viruses, which have a predilection for 2,6-linked sialic acid. To elucidate the existence and transmissibility of Î±2,3 sialic acid-specific viruses in H1N1pdm, amino acid substitutions within viral hemagglutinin molecules were investigated, especially D187E, D222G, and Q223R, which are related to a shift from human to avian receptor specificity. Samples from individuals infected during the first and second waves of the outbreak in Japan were examined using a high-throughput sequencing approach. In May 2009, three specimens from mild cases showed D222G and/or Q223R substitutions in a minor subpopulation of viruses infecting these individuals. However, the substitutions almost disappeared in the samples from five mild cases in December 2010. The D187E substitution was not widespread in specimens, even in May 2009. These results suggest that Î±2,3 sialic acid-specific viruses, including G222 and R223, existed in humans as a minor population in the early phase of the pandemic, and that D222 and Q223 became more dominant through human-to-human transmission during the first and second waves of the epidemic. These results are consistent with the low substitution rates identified in seasonal H1N1 viruses in 2008."

H9N2 viruses that contain such internal genes widely exist in poultry but are rarely reported in migratory birds. In this study, two strains of the H9N2 virus were isolated from fecal samples of migratory birds in 2014: one strain from Caizi Lake in Anhui Province and one from Chen Lake in Hubei Province of China. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed high homology of all six internal genes of these two strains with the internal genes of the human H10N8 virus in Jiangxi Province, as well as with the human H7N9 virus. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a possible origin of these two strains from poultry in South China. Both of the two viruses tested could replicated in respiratory organs of infective mice without adaption, by both strains of the H9N2 AIVs from wild birds, suggesting their potential capacity for directly infecting mammals. Our findings indicate the existence of H9N2 viruses that contain internal genes highly homologous with human H10N8 or H7N9 viruses. Wild birds can contribute to the spread of the H9N2 virus that contains the ""harmful"" internal gene complex, leading to gene rearrangement with other influenza viruses and to the generation of new pathogenic viruses. Therefore, strengthening AIV surveillance in wild birds can promote an understanding of the presence and prevalence of viruses and provide scientific evidence for the prevention and control of AIVs and human-infecting AIVs."

The objective of this study was to detect the presence of novel signatures that may serve as early warning indicators of the conversion of LPAI viruses to high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. This study included three H5N2 and one H5N3 viruses that were isolated from live poultry imported into Singapore as part of the national avian influenza virus (AIV) surveillance program. Based on the molecular criterion of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), sequence analysis with the translated amino acid (aa) sequence of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene revealed the absence of multibasic aa at the HA cleavage site, identifying all four virus isolates as LPAI. Detailed phylogenetic tree analyses using the HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes clustered these isolates in the Eurasian H5 lineage, but away from the HPAI H5 subtypes. This analysis further revealed that the internal genes clustered to different avian and swine subtypes, suggesting that the four isolates may possibly share their ancestry with these different influenza subtypes. Our results suggest that the four LPAI isolates in this study contained mainly avian signatures, and the phylogenetic tree for the internal genes further suggests the potential for reassortment with other different circulating avian subtypes. This is the first comprehensive report on the genetic characterization of LPAI H5N2/3 viruses isolated in South-East Asia."

They have been associated with gastroenteritis in humans and in pigs but not in other animals. In addition, some strains from pigs, chimpanzees and rodents show close sequence identity with human SaVs thereby suggesting the possibility of interspecies transmissions. Bats are known to be a major reservoir of zoonotic viruses, however, very little is known about the genetic diversity of SaVs in bats. To explore the genetic diversity of bat SaVs, fecal samples of Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus were treated according to the NetoVIR protocol and sequenced by Illumina technology. Nearly complete genome sequences of six highly divergent SaVs and one partial SaV (only VP1 region) were identified in Eidolon helvum and based on sequence identities and phylogenetic analysis, they potentially represent two novel genogroups, only distantly related to known SaVs. Furthermore, comparing these sequences with currently used screening primers and probes indicated that the novel SaVs would not be detected in routine epidemiological screening studies in humans in case an interspecies transmission would occur. Therefore, we designed and validated new primers that can detect both human and bat SaVs. In this study, we identified multiple novel bat SaVs, however, further epidemiological studies in humans are needed to unravel their potential role in gastroenteritis."

In recent years, the virus has caused several outbreaks with high numbers of deaths and severe neurological complications. Several new EV-71 subgenotypes were identified from these outbreaks. The mechanisms that contributed to the emergence of these subgenotypes are unknown. Six EV-71 isolates from an outbreak in Malaysia, in 1997, were sequenced completely. These isolates were identified as EV-71 subgenotypes, B3, B4 and C2. A phylogenetic tree that correlated well with the present enterovirus classification scheme was established using these full genome sequences and all other available full genome sequences of EV-71 and human enterovirus A (HEV-A). Using the 5' UTR, P2 and P3 genomic regions, however, isolates of EV-71 subgenotypes B3 and C4 segregated away from other EV-71 subgenotypes into a cluster together with coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16/G10) and EV-71 subgenotype C2 clustered with CV-A8. Results from the similarity plot analyses supported the clustering of these isolates with other HEV-A. In contrast, at the same genomic regions, a CV-A16 isolate, Tainan5079, clustered with EV-71. This suggests that amongst EV-71 and CV-A16, only the structural genes were conserved. The 3' end of the virus genome varied and consisted of sequences highly similar to various HEV-A viruses. Numerous recombination crossover breakpoints were identified within the non-structural genes of some of these newer EV-71 subgenotypes. Phylogenetic evidence obtained from analyses of the full genome sequence supports the possible occurrence of inter-typic recombination involving EV-71 and various HEV-A, including CV-A16, the most common causal agent of HFMD. It is suggested that these recombination events played important roles in the emergence of the various EV-71 subgenotypes."

These sequences were analyzed together with published sequences from 146 isolates from various parts of the world using a Bayesian coalescent approach as well as Bayesian inference and maximum-likelihood methods. All of the European-type (EU-type) viruses were classified into one of two groups or unclassified (4 isolates), while all North American-type (NA-type) viruses belonged to one of three major groups or were unclassified (5 isolates). Within each genotype, no apparent periodic and/or geographic influence on the evolution of PRRSVs was observed. The evolutionary rate of PRRSV isolates was estimated to be 1.55 Ã 10(-3) substitutions/site/year, and the time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) was 491.2 years ago. Here, the TMRCA for the EU- and NA-type viruses was 58.7 and 62.6 years ago, respectively. A Bayesian skyline plot revealed that the viruses evolved at an almost constant population size until the late 1970s, when they experienced a population expansion that continued until the late 1980s. The population size then remained constant again until the early 2000s, when a rapid, sharp decline in the effective number of infections occurred."

The results strongly supported the monophyly of five FMDV serotypes, O, A, Asia 1, C, and SAT 3, while sequences for the two remaining FMDV serotypes, SAT 1 and SAT 2 did not separate into entirely distinct clades. The phylogenomic tree revealed three sister-group relationships, serotype O + Asia 1, A + C, and SAT 1 + 3 + 2, with a new branching pattern: {[(O, Asia 1), (A, C)], (SAT 1, 2, 3)}. Within each serotype, there was no apparent periodic, geographic, or host species influence on the evolution of global FMDVs. Analysis of the polyprotein coding region of these sequences provided evidence for the influence of purifying selection on the evolution of FMDV. Using a Bayesian coalescent approach, the evolutionary rate of FMDV isolates that circulated during the years 1932-2007 was estimated to be 1.46 Ã 10(-3) substitutions/site/year, and the most recent common ancestor of the virus existed approximately 481 years ago.

About 1-10 cases with severe central nervous system symptoms have been constantly reported every year in Japan. To clarify the mechanism of maintenance of JEV, the present study surveyed pigs for serological evidence of JEV infection and isolated JEV strains from pigs and mosquitoes in Isahaya City (Isahaya) and Goto City (Goto) in the islets of Goto in Nagasaki Prefecture from 2008 to 2014. The serological survey of pigs showed the increase of IgM sero-positivity against JEV in July or August, and it was maintained until October or November in both Isahaya and Goto every year. There were 47 JEV strains isolated in Nagasaki from 2001 to 2014 including the isolates in this study, and they belonged to genotype 1. Thirty four of the isolated strains were from pigs in Isahaya and were classified under six subclusters (1-A-1, 1-A-2, 1-A-3, 1-A-4, 1-A-5, and 1-A-9). Thirteen strains were isolated from pigs and mosquitoes in Goto and were classified into three subclusters (1-A-5 (2008); 1-A-1 (2009); and 1-A-2).

These data strongly suggested that JEV appearance in Goto seems to depend on the frequent introduction of JEV from outside of the island and this pattern is different from what has been observed in subtropical islands in the East China Sea such as Okinawa and Taiwan, where the same populations of JEV (1-A-7 (1998-2008) in Okinawa; genotype 3 (until 2012) in Taiwan) have been maintained for a long period."

This paper reports the genetic characteristics of the CV-A6 entire viral protein 1 (VP1) derived from patients with HFMD in Fukuoka between 2013 and 2017. CV-A6 was detected in 105 of 280 clinical specimens, and the entire VP1 sequences could be analyzed for 90 of the 105 specimens. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the CV-A6 strains were classified into clade A and subgrouped into subclade A3 or subclade A4. Each subclade strain carried amino acid substitutions in the presumed DE and GH loops of the VP1, and no amino acid substitutions were identified as deleterious to the protein function. No significant difference was found in the clinical symptoms between the genetic subclades using statistical analyses. In conclusion, this study clarified the genetic diversity of CV-A6 in Fukuoka from 2013 to 2017. The emergence of the CV-A6 strains was classified into derived new subclades based on phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene that may cause CV-A6-associated HFMD epidemics approximately every 2 years."

In this study, we reported avian-like H1N1 and novel ressortant H1N2 influenza viruses from pigs in China. Homology and phylogenetic analyses showed that the H1N1 virus (A/swine/Zhejiang/1/07) was closely to avian-like H1N1 viruses and seemed to be derived from the European swine H1N1 viruses, which was for the first time reported in China; and the two H1N2 viruses (A/swine/Shanghai/1/07 and A/swine/Guangxi/13/06) were novel ressortant H1N2 influenza viruses containing genes from the classical swine (HA, NP, M and NS), human (NA and PB1) and avian (PB2 and PA) lineages, which indicted that the reassortment among human, avian, and swine influenza viruses had taken place in pigs in China and resulted in the generation of new viruses. The isolation of avian-like H1N1 influenza virus originated from the European swine H1N1 viruses, especially the emergence of two novel ressortant H1N2 influenza viruses provides further evidence that pigs serve as intermediate hosts or ""mixing vessels"", and swine influenza virus surveillance in China should be given a high priority."

In conclusion, genetic diversity of H9N2 influenza viruses from pigs in China provides further evidence that avian to pig interspecies transmission of H9N2 viruses did occur and might result in the generation of new reassortant viruses by genetic reassortment with swine H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 influenza viruses, therefore, these swine H9N2 influenza viruses might be a potential threat to human health and continuing to carry out swine influenza virus surveillance in China is of great significance."

All the eight genes of the three viruses are highly homologous to recent (about 2000) and early (1980s) human H1N1 influenza viruses, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that A/Swine/Guangdong/96/06 was directly derived from about 2000 human H1N1 influenza viruses, while A/swine/Tianjin/01/04 and A/swine/Henan/01/06 seemed to be descendants of human H1N1 viruses circulating in 1980s. Seroprevalence of our isolate (A/swine/Guangdong/96/06) confirmed the presence of human-like H1N1 virus in pigs in China. Existence of these influenza viruses, especially older viruses (A/swine/Tianjin/01/04 and A/swine/Henan/01/06), indicates that human-like H1N1 influenza viruses may remain invariant for long periods in pigs and provides the evidence that pigs serve as reservoirs of older influenza viruses for human pandemics."

The unique reads (348, 70 and 13) had limited similarity to known astroviruses, bocaviruses and parechoviruses. Specific primers were synthesized to assess the prevalence of the viruses in healthy piglets. Our results indicate extremely high rates of positivity. Several novel astroviruses, bocaviruses and Ljungan-like viruses were identified in stool samples from healthy pigs. The rates of isolation for the new viruses were high. The high detection rate, diverse sequences and categories indicate that pigs are well-established reservoirs for and likely sources of different enteric viruses."

The complete genome of the virus comprises 6832 bp, encoding a predicted polyprotein of 2132 amino acids that is most similar to Ljungan virus (32% identity). A similar virus that belongs to a novel Picornaviridae genus, named swine pasivirus 1 (SPaV-1), was reported during the preparation of this paper. Sequence analysis revealed that PLV-CHN and SPaV1 shared 82% nucleotide identity and 89% amino acid identity. Further genomic and phylogenetic analyses suggested that both SPaV1 and PLV-CHN shared similar genomic characteristics and belong to the same novel Picornaviridae genus. A total of 36 (20.0%) fecal samples from 180 healthy piglets were positive for PLV-CHN by RT-PCR, while no fecal samples from 100 healthy children and 100 children with diarrhea, and no cerebrospinal fluid samples from 196 children with suspected viral encephalitis, was positive for the virus. However, Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using recombinant PLV-CHN VP1 polypeptide as an antigen showed a high seroprevalence of 63.5% in the healthy population. When grouped by age, the antibody-positivity rates showed that the majority of children under 12 years of age have been infected by the virus. It was suggested that PLV-CHN, SPaV1, or an as-yet-uncharacterized virus can infect humans early in life. Thus, investigation of the role of this novel virus is vital."

We isolated a novel pseudorabies virus (PRV), named HNX strain, from the brain of abortion fetuses to diagnose the disease. To reveal the genomic organization and characterize the HNX strain, the complete genomes of HNX and Fa strain, an isolate in the 1960s, were sequenced and analyzed. The genomic size of HNX and Fa strains were 142,294 and 141,930 nt, respectively, with corresponding GÂ +Â C contents of 73.56 and 73.70Â %. The two strains consistently possessed 70 open reading frames. In addition, comparative genomic analysis between HNX and Bartha strains was performed to understand the possible reason of immune failure. The major virulence-associated genes of HNX strain had slight changes, whereas glycoprotein B and glycoprotein C genes of HNX strain had 73 mutations; the homology at the whole genomic level between HNX and Bartha strains was 90.6Â %. Genome-wide comparison between HNX and Fa strains indicated that the strains shared about 96.4Â % of homology and clustered in a separate Chinese isolate group; the two strains are also distant from the isolates from other countries. Similarity plot and bootscanning analysis of complete genome sequences of nine PRV strains, including HNX and Fa, four newly Chinese strains, and three traditional reference strains, revealed that non-recombination events occurred in the HNX strain. The PRV HNX strain with genomic variations might contribute to the PR outbreak in China since the later part of 2011."

Live poultry markets were suspected locations of the human H7N9 infection sources, based on the cases' exposure histories and sequence similarities between viral isolates. To explore the role of live poultry markets in the origin of the novel H7N9 virus, we systematically examined poultry and environmental specimens from local markets and farms in Hangzhou, using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) as well as high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS). RT-PCR identified specimens positive for the H7 and N9 genomic segments in all of the 12 poultry markets epidemiologically linked to 10 human H7N9 cases. Chickens, ducks, and environmental specimens from the markets contained heavily mixed subtypes, including H7, N9, H9, and N2 and sometimes H5 and N1. The idea of the coexistence of H7N9 and H9N2 subtypes in chickens was further supported by metagenomic sequencing. In contrast, human H7N9 infection cases (n = 31) were all negative for H9N2 virus according to real-time RT-PCR. The six internal segments were indistinguishable for the H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H9, N2, and internal-segment sequences were very close to the sequence of the H9N2 virus circulating in chickens in China recently. Our results provide direct evidence that H9N2 strains coexisted with the novel human-pathogenic H7N9 influenza virus in epidemiologically linked live poultry markets. Avian influenza A virus of the H9N2 subtype likely made a recent contribution to the evolution of the H7N9 virus and continues to do so. Our results suggest that avian influenza A virus of the H9N2 subtype likely made a recent contribution to the evolution of the H7N9 virus, a novel reassortant avian influenza virus A subtype, and continues to do so. The finding helps shed light on how the H7N9 virus emerged, spread, and transmitted to humans. It is of considerable interest for assessing the risk of the possible emergence of novel reassortant viruses with enhanced transmissibility to humans."

Here, we examined poultry specimens from live bird markets linked to human H7N9 infection in Hangzhou, China. Metagenomic sequencing revealed mixed subtypes (H5, H7, H9, N1, N2, and N9). Subsequently, AIV subtypes H5N9, H7N9, and H9N2 were isolated. Evolutionary analysis showed that the hemagglutinin gene of the novel H5N9 virus originated from A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/LBM227/2012 (H5N1), which belongs to clade 2.3.2.1. The neuraminidase gene of the novel H5N9 virus originated from human-infective A/Hangzhou/1/2013 (H7N9). The six internal genes were similar to those of other H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 virus strains. The virus harbored the PQRERRRKR/GL motif characteristic of highly pathogenic AIVs at the HA cleavage site. Receptor-binding experiments demonstrated that the virus binds Î±-2,3 sialic acid but not Î±-2,6 sialic acid. Identically, pathogenicity experiments also showed that the virus caused low mortality rates in mice. This newly isolated H5N9 virus is a highly pathogenic reassortant virus originating from H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes. Live bird markets represent a potential transmission risk to public health and the poultry industry. This investigation confirms that the novel H5N9 subtype avian influenza A virus is a reassortant strain originating from H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes and is totally different from the H5N9 viruses reported before. The novel H5N9 virus acquired a highly pathogenic H5 gene and an N9 gene from human-infecting subtype H7N9 but caused low mortality rates in mice. Whether this novel H5N9 virus will cause human infections from its avian host and become a pandemic subtype is not known yet. It is therefore imperative to assess the risk of emergence of this novel reassortant virus with potential transmissibility to public health."

HEV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus classified in the family Hepeviridae and encompasses four known Genotypes (1-4), at least two new putative genotypes of mammalian HEV, and one floating genus of avian HEV. Genotypes 1 and 2 HEVs only affect humans, while Genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic and responsible for sporadic and autochthonous infections in both humans and several other animal species worldwide. HEV has an ever-expanding host range and has been identified in numerous animal species. Swine serve as a reservoir species for HEV transmission to humans; however, it is likely that other animal species may also act as reservoirs. HEV poses an important public health concern with cases of the disease definitively linked to handling of infected pigs, consumption of raw and undercooked animal meats, and animal manure contamination of drinking or irrigation water. Infectious HEV has been identified in numerous sources of concern including animal feces, sewage water, inadequately-treated water, contaminated shellfish and produce, as well as animal meats. Many aspects of HEV pathogenesis, replication, and immunological responses remain unknown, as HEV is an extremely understudied but important human pathogen. This article reviews the current understanding of HEV transmission routes with emphasis on food and environmental sources and the prevalence of HEV in animal species with zoonotic potential in humans."

As expected, mosquitoes from Bangkok showed higher mitochondrial diversity and carried alleles associated with knock-down resistance to pyrethroids. Blood meal reads primarily mapped to human genes, with a small number also showing homology with rat/mouse and dog genes.

Matrix protein gene sequences for PPMV-1 isolates clustered together as a group relative to isolates from other species phylogenetically. However, there were also isolates from pigeons or doves that grouped with APMV-1 isolates from other species. This indicates that PPMV-1 may be circulating among Columbidae members as a distinct lineage, but that these avian species may also harbor other NDV strains as well.

The main cause of sporadic autochthonous type E acute hepatitis in developed countries is genotype 3, which has a worldwide distribution and widely infects pigs. The aim of this study was to make hypotheses concerning the origin and global dispersion routes of this genotype by reconstructing the spatial and temporal dynamics of 208 HEV genotype 3 ORF-2 sequences (retrieved from public databases) isolated in different geographical areas. The evolutionary rates, time of the most recent common ancestors (tMRCAs), epidemic growth and phylogeography of HEV-3 were co-estimated using a MCMC Bayesian method. The maximum clade credibility tree showed the existence of two distinct main clades: clade A, which consists of only European subtypes (HEV-3e and 3f), and clade B, which consists of European subtype 3c and all of the Asian subtypes (3a, 3b and 3d) sharing a common ancestor, which most probably existed in Asia in 1920s. All of the North American isolates belonged to Asian subtype 3a. On the basis of our time-scaled phylogeographical reconstruction, we hypothesise that after originating in the early 1800s in Europe, HEV reached Asia in the first decades of 1900, and then moved to America probably in the 1970s-1980s. Analysis of the skyline plot showed a sharp increase of the number of infections between the 1980s and 2005, thus suggesting the intervention of new and highly efficient routes of transmission possibly related to changes in the pig industry."

Almost all incidents caused by such emerging pathogens could be ascribed to agents that are zoonotic or expanded their host range and crossed species barriers. Many different factors influence the status of a pathogen to remain unnoticed or evolves into a worldwide threat. The ability of an infectious agent to adapt to changing environmental conditions and variations in human behavior, population development, nutrition, education, social, and health status are relevant factors affecting the correlation between pathogen and host. Hantaviruses belong to the emerging pathogens having gained more and more attention in the last decades. These viruses are members of the family Bunyaviridae and are grouped into a separate genus known as Hantavirus. The serotypes Hantaan (HTN), Seoul (SEO), Puumala (PUU), and Dobrava (DOB) virus predominantly cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a disease characterized by renal failure, hemorrhages, and shock. In the recent past, many hantavirus isolates have been identified and classified in hitherto unaffected geographic regions in the New World (North, Middle, and South America) with characteristic features affecting the lungs of infected individuals and causing an acute pulmonary syndrome. Hantavirus outbreaks in the United States of America at the beginning of the 10th decade of the last century fundamentally changed our knowledge about the appearance of the hantavirus specific clinical picture, mortality, origin, and transmission route in human beings. The hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) was first recognized in 1993 in the Four Corners Region of the United States and had a lethality of more than 50%. Although the causative virus was first termed in connection with the geographic name of its outbreak region the analysis of the individual viruses indicate that the causing virus of HPS was a genetically distinct hantavirus and consequently termed as Sin Nombre virus. Hantaviruses are distributed worldwide and are assumed to share a long time period of co-evolution with specific rodent species as their natural reservoir. The degree of relatedness between virus serotypes normally coincides with the relatedness between their respective hosts. There are no known diseases that are associated with hantavirus infections in rodents underlining the amicable relationship between virus and host developed by mutual interaction in hundreds of thousands of years. Although rodents are the major reservoir, antibodies against hantaviruses are also present in domestic and wild animals like cats, dogs, pigs, cattle, and deer. Domestic animals and rodents live jointly in a similar habitat. Therefore the transmission of hantaviruses from rodents to domestic animals seems to be possible, if the target organs, tissues, and cell parenchyma of the co-habitat domestic animals possess adequate virus receptors and are suitable for hantavirus entry and replication. The most likely incidental infection of species other than rodents as for example humans turns hantaviruses from harmless to life-threatening pathogenic agents focusing the attention on this virus group, their ecology and evolution in order to prevent the human population from a serious health risk. Much more studies on the influence of non-natural hosts on the ecology of hantaviruses are needed to understand the directions that the hantavirus evolution could pursue. At least, domestic animals that share their environmental habitat with rodents and humans particularly in areas known as high endemic hantavirus regions have to be copiously screened. Each transfer of hantaviruses from their original natural hosts to other often incidental hosts is accompanied by a change of ecology, a change of environment, a modulation of numerous factors probably influencing the pathogenicity and virulence of the virus. The new environment exerts a modified evolutionary pressure on the virus forcing it to adapt and probably to adopt a form that is much more dangerous for other host species compared to the original one."

Comparison of the sequences of six American and eleven German BEV isolates with published BEV sequences revealed the necessity to revise the taxonomy of these viruses. Molecular data indicate that the bovine enteroviruses are composed of two clusters (designated BEV-A and -B) each with two and three geno-/serotypes, respectively. Whereas low amino acid identity of the capsid proteins 1C (VP3) and 1D (VP1) is the main criterion for the discrimination of geno-/serotypes, the BEV clusters, presumably representing species, differ in sequence identity of all viral proteins. In addition, characteristic lengths of (i) the capsid proteins 1B, 1C and 1D, (ii) the 2C protein, and (iii) the 3'-non-translated region are observed. The BEVs can be distinguished from the other enteroviruses by sequence identity and unique features of the 5'-non-translated region, i.e. a conserved second cloverleaf and characteristic RNA structures of the internal ribosome entry site. Phylogenetically, the closest relatives of the bovine enteroviruses are the porcine enteroviruses. Incongruent phylogenies of the 5'-non-translated region, the capsid proteins and the 3D polymerase indicate frequent intraserotypic and interserotypic recombination within the non-capsid and the capsid region of the BEV genome."

Previous nucleic acid sequence analyses have demonstrated that enteroviruses and rhinoviruses of the family Picornaviridae exhibit a similar structure of the 5'-nontranslated region (NTR) differing significantly from the 5'-NTR of cardiovirus, aphthovirus, hepatovirus, and echovirus 22 (provisionally parechovirus 1). Available nucleotide sequence information of the 5'- and 3'-nontranslated regions of more than 70 serotypes of enteroviruses, bovine enteroviruses and rhinoviruses has been compared and correlated with previous findings obtained after analysis of the coding and noncoding genome regions. As a result, the 5'- and 3'-NTRs of all three virus groups are characterized by group-specific nucleotide sequences. Focusing on bovine enterovirus (BEV) serotypes, unique characteristics in all secondary structures of the NTRs were observed. These features clearly separate the BEVs from the human enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. Concerning the 5'-NTR, the most remarkable property is an insertion of about 110 nucleotides between the putative cloverleaf structure at the very 5'-end of the viral genome and the IRES element. This insertion was demonstrated for BEV 1 and 2 and has a predicted folding pattern which is very similar to the 5'-cloverleaf structure. One stem-loop of this second cloverleaf is almost identical to the 3CDpro-binding domain of rhinoviral 5'-cloverleafs. It was also demonstrated that the IRES elements and the 3'-NTRs of both, enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, have group-specific features which differ significantly from the corresponding genome regions of BEV. These results suggest that bovine enteroviruses hold an exceptional taxonomic position besides the established genera Enterovirus and Rhinovirus. Within the Enterovirus and Rhinovirus genera, the existence of virus clusters representing subgenera was previously proposed. Whereas the 5'-NTRs of the four human enterovirus clusters fall into two groups, all four clusters have characteristic secondary structures at the 3'-NTR supporting the concept of enterovirus clusters. For rhinoviruses, the existence of two virus clusters was confirmed."

GTPV can cause significant economic losses of domestic ruminants in endemic regions and can threaten breeding stocks. In this study, we report on the compilation of the complete genomic sequence of an isolated GTPV field strain FZ (GTPV_FZ). The 150,194bp GTPV genome consists of a central coding region bounded by two identical 2301bp inverted terminal repeats and contains 151 putative genes. Comparative genomic analysis reveals the apparent genetic relationships among Capripoxviruses are close, but sufficient genomic variants in the field isolate strain FZ have been identified to distinguish it from other GTPV strains and other Capripoxvirus species. Phylogenetic analysis based on the p32 and complete GTPV genome can be used to differentiate SPPVs, GTPVs and LSDVs. These data may contribute to the epidemiological study of the Chinese capripoxvirus and help to develop more specific detection methods to distinguish GTPVs, SPPVs and LSDVs."

So, we performed high-throughput sequencing and transcriptomic analysis to identify functional miRNAs, in order to figure out the possible mechanism in the interaction of REV with CEF. In total, 50 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were identified. Then target genes of DEmiRNAs were predicted and identified by transcriptome profile results. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment were conducted to analyze the identified target genes of miRNAs which showed that metabolism, cell cycle, and apoptosis were the most related pathways involved in infection of REV. We analyzed the genes related to cell cycle which indicated that CyclinD1-CDK6 complex played an important role in regulating the transition of the cell cycle from G1 phase to S phase during REV infection. Fluorescence microscope identification showed that REV inhibited the apoptosis of CEF which was in accordance with transcriptome results. A novel miRNA, named novel-72 was found, KEGG analysis was conducted to predict the biological function of its target genes which showed that those target genes were significantly enriched in mTOR signaling pathway and functioned to promote cell cycle and cell growth during the REV infection. In conclusion, REV could induce the up-regulation of cell metabolism, cell cycle and mTOR signaling pathway while inhibit apoptosis of the cell."

The 15 distinct mammalian viruses identified in the pooled diarrhoeic sample were, in order of abundance of nucleic acid sequence, Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), sapovirus, porcine bocavirus-4 (PBoV-4), sapelovirus, torovirus, coronavirus, PBoV-2, stool-associated single-stranded DNA virus (poSCV), astrovirus (AstV), kobuvirus, posavirus-1, porcine enterovirus-9 (PEV-9), porcine circovirus-like (po-circo-like) virus, picobirnavirus (PBV) and Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV-2). The prevalence rate of each virus was verified from diarrhoeic and healthy piglets by PCR assay. A mean of 5.5 different viruses were shed in diarrhoeic piglets, and one piglet was in fact co-infected with 11 different viruses. By contrast, healthy piglets shed a mean of 3.2 different viruses. Compared with samples from healthy piglets, the co-infection of PEDV and PBoV had a high prevalence rate in diarrhoea samples, suggesting a correlation with the appearance of diarrhoea in piglets. Furthermore, we report here for the first time the presence of several recently described viruses in China, and the identification of novel genotypes. Therefore, our investigation results provide an unbiased survey of viral communities and prevalence in faecal samples of piglets."

It causes devastating viral enteric disease in piglets with a high mortality rate, leading to significant threats and huge economic loss to the pork industry. In this study, a transcriptomic shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) procedure was used to study gene responses against PEDV infection. Genome-wide analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed in Vero E6 cells post-PEDV infection. mTOR signaling pathway activator-MHY1485, and inhibitor-PP242 were used to study the antiviral function. Results revealed that the IRF3 was significantly up-regulated post-PEDV infection. Although most of the IFN-regulatory and -related genes evaluated in this study were either down-regulated or remained unchanged, IL11 behaved significantly up-regulated, with the peak at 16 hpi. Nearly 90% of PEDV infections were suppressed in the PP242 pretreated cells whereas the reverse effect was observed in the MYH1485 pretreated cells. Results indicated that the mTOR signaling pathway played a vital role in the PEDV antiviral regulation in the Vero E6 cells.

We report here the complete genome sequence of SC0806 isolated from mosquitoes (Culex tritaeniorhynchus) in Sichuan Province, China. Consistent with the genomic organization of Simbu serogroup viruses, the SC0806 genome comprises three RNA segments-a large (L) segment (6928 nucleotides) that encodes the 2261-amino-acid RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a medium (M) segment (4481 nucleotides) that encodes the 1433-amino-acid polyprotein, and a small (S) segment (984 nucleotides) that encodes a 234-amino-acid nucleocapsid protein and a 95-amino-acid nonstructural protein. The respective lengths of the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and 3'-UTR of L, M, and S are 56 and 86, 43 and 136, and 44 and 238 nucleotides. Sequence (nucleotide and deduced amino acid) comparison and phylogenetic analysis revealed that SC0806 was closely related to the reported Vietnam isolate CQV. This is the first time that CQV has been isolated in Sichuan Province, China. Anti-SC0806 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies were found in pigs reared locally, indicating that CQV has formed a natural cycle in the local area.

We developed and applied a procedure for high-throughput RNA sequencing of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) from cell culture-derived isolates and clinical specimens. Ten PRRSV isolates with known sequence information, 2 mixtures each with 2 different PRRSV isolates, and 51 clinical specimens (19 sera, 16 lungs, and 16 oral fluids) with various PCR threshold cycle (Ct) values were subjected to nucleic acid extraction, cDNA library preparation (24-plexed), and sequencing. Whole genome sequences were obtained from 10 reference isolates with expected sequences and from sera with a PRRSV real-time reverse transcription PCR Ct â¤ 23.6, lung tissues with Ct â¤ 21, and oral fluids with Ct â¤ 20.6. For mixtures with PRRSV-1 and -2 isolates (57.8% nucleotide identity), NGS was able to distinguish them as well as obtain their respective genome sequences.

It causes mortality of up to 80% in 3-6-week-old broilers, posing a substantial threat to the poultry industry. However, the specific host responses to the virus are not well understood. To better understand the interactions between the host and FAdV-4 and to explore the pathogenesis of this virus, a high-throughput RNA-seq technology was utilized with leghorn male hepatocellular (LMH) cells at 12, 24, and 48â¯h after FAdV-4 infection. We identified a total of 7000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were enriched in a variety of biological processes and pathways using the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Several immune related pathways, including Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway, were activated after the FAdV-4 infection. The transcriptional data were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. The expression profiles of 10 genes involved in FAdV-4-infected chicken livers, including TLR2A, TLR3, TLR5, MyD88, IL12B, IL15, IL18, CCL20, TNFRSF21, and CD30, were consistent with RNA-seq profiles. By transfecting small interfering RNA into LMH cells, our results confirmed that MyD88 mediated FAdV-4-induced inflammation. To our knowledge, this was the first study to use transcriptome analysis to investigate host responses to FAdV-4 infection. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of FAdV-4 pathogenesis and host-FAdV-4 interaction."

It can be caused by over 150 different microorganisms, where Staphylococcus aureus is the most frequently isolated and a major pathogen responsible for heavy economic losses in dairy industry. Although antibiotic therapy is most widely used, alternative treatments are necessary due to the increasing antibiotic resistance. Using phage for pathogen control is a promising tool in the fight against antibiotic resistance. Mainly using high-throughput sequencing, bioinformatics and our proposed phage termini identification method, we have isolated and characterized a novel virulent phage, designated as vB_SauS_IMEP5, from manure collected from dairy farms in Shihezi, Xinjiang, China, for use as a biocontrol agent against Staphylococcus aureus infections. Its latent period was about 30Â min and its burst size was approximately 272PFU/cell. Phage vB_SauS_IMEP5 survives in a wide pH range between 3 and 12. A treatment at 70Â Â°C for 20Â min can inactive the phage. Morphological analysis of vB_SauS_IMEP5 revealed that phage vB_SauS_IMEP5 morphologically resembles phages in the family Siphoviridae. Among our tested multiplicity of infections (MOIs), the optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI) of this phage was determined to be 0.001, suggesting that phage vB_SauS_IMEP5 has high bacteriolytic potential and good efficiency for reducing bacterial growth. The complete genome of IME-P5 is a 44,677-bp, linear, double-stranded DNA, with a G+C content of 34.26%, containing 69 putative ORFs. The termini of genome were determined with next-generation sequencing data using our previously proposed termini identification method, which suggests that this phage has non-redundant termini with 9nt 3' protruding cohesive ends. The genomic and proteomic characteristics of IMEP5 demonstrate that this phage does not belong to any of the previously recognized Siphoviridae Staphylococcus phage groups, suggesting the creation of a new lineage, thus adding to the knowledge on the diversity of Staphylococcus phages. An N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase gene and several conserved genes were predicted, while no virulence or antibiotic resistance genes were identified. This study isolated and characterized a novel S. aureus phage vB_SauS_IMEP5, and our findings suggest that this phage may be potentially utilized as a therapeutic or prophylactic candidate against S.aureus infections."

Although the protection provided by vaccination is limited during early infection, it is recognized as the best method to prevent FMD outbreaks. Furthermore, the mechanism of host early responses against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection remains unclear. In our study, a pig kidney cell line (PK-15) was used as a cell model to reveal the mechanism of early pig responses to FMDV infection. Four non-treated control and four FMDV-treated PK-15 cells were sequenced with RNA-seq technology, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed. The results showed that 1212 DEGs were in the FMDV-infected PK-15 cells, including 914 up-regulated and 298 down-regulated genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were significantly enriched in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF), cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, NOD-like receptor, toll-like receptor, NF-ÎºB, and the chemokine signaling pathways. To verify the results of the DEGs, 30 immune-related DEGs (19 up-regulated and 11 down-regulated) were selected for Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) verification. The results showed that RT-qPCR-measured genes exhibited a similar pattern as the RNA-seq analyses. Based on bioinformatics analysis, during FMDV early infection, we found that a series of cytokines, such as interleukins (IL6), chemokines (CXCL2, CCL20 and CCL4), and transcription factors (ZFP36, FOS, NFKBIA, ZBTB3, ZNF503, ZNF283, dymeclin (DYM), and orthodenticle homeobox 1 (OTX1)) were involved in the battle between FMDV and the host. Combined with their features and functions, we propose inflammation as the main early mechanism by which the host responds to FMDV infection. These data provide an additional panel of candidate genes for deciphering the mechanisms of a hostâs early response against FMDV infection.</jats:p>"

A two-step clustering method was used to divide strains into groups, and then a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on cluster results. Evolution rate in lineages were future estimated. Tree structure showed three lineages: horse/canine, human/swine and avian. As a single trunk, the human/swine lineage was mainly composed of human strains, and more big branches appeared in recent years. Tree topology showed no evidence that swine affected the main evolution tendency of human H3 strains. The evolution rate of H3 strains varied between lineages. We observed that the rate in the human lineage decreased from 3.2 substitutions/year before 1980 to 1.8 after 1997. We concluded that the variation of human H3 gene was associated with swine strains but independent of others, including bird strains. The evolution rate of human H3 strains seems to have decreased in recent years, while the reasons for the rate change need to be further explored."

Six previously known viruses were also identified: feline coronavirus type 1, felid herpes 1, feline calicivirus, feline norovirus, feline panleukopenia virus and picobirnavirus. Novel species of astroviruses and bocaviruses, and the first genome of a cyclovirus in a feline were characterized. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region from four highly divergent partial viral genomes in the order <jats:italic>Picornavirales</jats:italic> were sequenced. The detection of such a diverse collection of viruses shed within a single shelter suggested that such animals experience robust viral exposures.

Viral metagenomics of US store bought beef, pork, and chicken.","We describe here the metagenomics-derived viral sequences detected in beef, pork, and chicken purchased from stores in San Francisco. In beef we detected four previously reported viruses (two parvoviruses belonging to different genera, an anellovirus, and one circovirus-like virus) and one novel bovine polyomavirus species (BPyV2-SF) whose closest relatives infect primates. Detection of porcine hokovirus in beef indicated that this parvovirus can infect both ungulate species. In pork we detected four known parvoviruses from three genera, an anellovirus, and pig circovirus 2. Chicken meat contained numerous gyrovirus sequences including those of chicken anemia virus and of a novel gyrovirus species (GyV7-SF). Our results provide an initial characterization of some of the viruses commonly found in US store-bought meats which included a diverse group of parvoviruses and viral families with small circular DNA genomes. Whether any of these viruses can infect humans will require testing human sera for specific antibodies."

Antibodies to HEV and HEV RNA have been detected in some Chinese population and swine groups but few other domestic animals. In this study, to investigate the HEV prevalence, we tested sera from 788 pigs, 100 cows, 50 goats, 49 horses, 101 pet dogs, 105 chickens, 47 duck and 45 pigeons in eastern China for anti-HEV immunoglobulin G (IgG). We also tested 50% of the swine sera, all of sera from the other domestic animals and 13 Shanghai human sera which were positive for anti-HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM) for HEV RNA using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Our results indicated that 82.5% (222/269) of the sows, 53.9% (104/193) of the 4- to 6-month-old swine, 63.4% (168/265) of the 1- to 3-month-old swine, 55.7% (34/61) of the slaughterhouse swine, 24% (12/50) of the goats, 16.3% (8/49) of the horses, 17.8% (21/101) of the pet dogs, 6% (6/100) of the cows, 12.8% (6/47) of the ducks, 4.4% (2/45) of the pigeons and 1.9% (2/105) of the chickens exhibited positive for anti-HEV IgG. Inhibition assay confirmed the infection with HEV or HEV-like viruses in these domestic animals except pigeons and chickens. From the sera, we isolated 18 swine HEV strains, one horse HEV strain and two human HEV strains. Sequence analysis showed that the horse HEV isolate and one swine isolate belonged to genotype 3. The other isolates belonged to genotype 4. The two human isolates were phylogenetically closely related to eight of the swine isolates. In short, the presence of anti-HEV antibody had been confirmed in several species of domestic animals in eastern China and HEV RNA has been identified in swine, human and horse. This suggested that the authorities should pay more attention to the prevalence of HEV in eastern China."

An open reading frame of 1272 nucleotides was identified as the putative HE gene by homology to the bovine coronavirus HE gene. This open reading frame encodes a protein of 424 amino acids with an estimated molecular weight of 47.7 kDa. Ten potential N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted in the HE protein of HCV-OC43 while nine of them were present in BRCV-G95. Fourteen cysteine residues were conserved in the HE proteins of both viruses. Two hydrophobic sequences at the N-terminus and the C-terminus may serve as signal peptide and transmembrane anchoring domain, respectively. The predicted HE protein of HCV-OC43 was 95% identical to the HEs of BRCV-G95 and other bovine coronaviruses, and 60% identical to the HEs of mouse hepatitis viruses.

The results showed that 104 known miRNAs and 9 new miRNA candidates were differentially expressed in ST cells after JEV infection. We identified 396 differentially expressed mRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis identified 435 known miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs and 94 novel miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs involving miRNAs inversely correlated with the expression of their predicted target mRNAs. The known miRNAs inversely correlated with their target genes were involved in the biological processes of immunity, cytokine production, inflammation, and apoptosis. Selected miRNA-mRNA interactions were validated by luciferase reporter assay. Overall, our findings indicate that miRNAs may play critical roles in the pathogenesis of JEV infection."

Through enhanced surveillance, infection by the H7N9 virus in humans was first identified in Zhejiang Province. Real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) was used to confirm the infection. Embryonated chicken eggs were used for virus isolation from pharyngeal swabs taken from infected human patients. The H7N9 isolates were first identified by the hemagglutination test and electron microscopy, then used for whole genome sequencing. Bioinformatics software was used to construct the phylogenetic tree and for computing the mean rate of evolution of the HA gene in H7Nx and NA in HxN9. Two novel H7N9 avian influenza A viruses (A/Zhejiang/1/2013 and A/Zhejiang/2/2013) were isolated from the positive infection cases. Substitutions were found in both Zhejiang isolates and were identified as human-type viruses. All phylogenetic results indicated that the novel reassortant in H7N9 originated in viruses that infected birds. The sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome revealed the mean rate of evolution of the HA gene in H7NX to be 5.74E-3 (95% Highest posterior density: 3.8218E-3 to 7.7873E-3) while the NA gene showed 2.243E-3 (4.378E-4 to 3.79E-3) substitutions per nucleotide site per year. The novel reassortant H7N9 virus was confirmed by molecular methods to have originated in poultry, with the mutations occurring during the spread of the H7N9 virus infection. Live poultry markets played an important role in whole H7N9 circulation."

Extensive studies on HIV-1 have revealed various strategies employed by the virus to escape host immune surveillance. Here, we investigated the human antibody gene repertoires of uninfected and HIV-1-infected individuals at genomic DNA (gDNA) and cDNA levels by deep sequencing followed by high-throughput sequence analysis to determine the frequencies of putative germline antibody genes of known HIV-1 monoclonal bnAbs (bnmAbs). Combinatorial gDNA and cDNA antibody libraries were constructed using the gDNAs and mRNAs isolated from uninfected and HIV-1-infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). All libraries were deep sequenced and sequences analysed using IMGT/HighV-QUEST software (http://imgt.org/HighV-QUEST/index.action). The frequencies of putative germline antibodies of known bnmAbs in the gDNA and cDNA libraries were determined. The human gDNA antibody libraries were more diverse in heavy and light chain V-gene lineage usage than the cDNA libraries, indicating that the human gDNA antibody gene repertoires may have more potential than the cDNA repertoires to develop HIV-1 bnAbs. The frequencies of the heavy and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions with identical V(D)J recombinations to known HIV-1 bnmAbs were extremely low in human antibody gene repertoires. However, we found relatively high frequencies of the heavy and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions that used the same V-genes and had the same CDR3 lengths as known HIV-1 bnmAbs regardless of (D)J-gene usage. B-cells bearing B-cell receptors of such heavy and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions may be stimulated to induce HIV-1 bnAbs."

Flavivirus replication depends on the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induces ER stress that leads to activation of the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR), an important signalling pathway that regulates many biological functions involved in viral pathogenesis and innate immunity. However, the mechanism of TMUV-induced UPR activation remains unclear. In this study, we systematically investigated the three UPR pathways in TMUV-infected BHK-21 cells. Our results showed that expression of glucose-related protein 78 (GRP78) and GRP94 was upregulated during the course of TMUV infection. We then demonstrated that TMUV activated the PERK pathway in the early stage of infection, resulting in upregulation of ATF4, GADD34 and CHOP, with CHOP induction leading to caspase-3 activation. We also found the IRE1 pathway to be activated, leading to splicing of X box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA and enhanced expression of p58 This is the first report that TMUV infection-induced ER stress activates three branches of the UPR, and these results lay the foundation for elucidating the pathogenesis of TMUV and understanding the inherent mechanism of TMUV infection as well as the host response."

It has an important economic impact throughout the world. As well, it is a considerable threat to food security. At present, the molecular mechanism of FMDV infection is not clear to a large extent. Innate immune response is the first line of defense against infectious diseases. The systematic analysis of the host immune response to infection has an important role in understanding the pathogenesis of infection. However, there are few reports about effect of immune regulation on virus replication in the interaction of virus and host cellular. High-throughput RNA-seq technology as a powerful and efficient means for transcript analysis provides a new insight into FMDV study. In this study, RNA extracted from pig PBMCs infected with O subtype FMDV at 4 dpi. A total of 29942658 and 31452917 Illumina read pairs were obtained from the non-infected (NI) group and infected (I) group, respectively. The clean bases for all samples are 3.61G (NI group) and 3.79G (I group), respectively. The clean reads of the NI and I group that mapped to pig genome data were 47195073 (81.82%) and 46556714 (76.85%), respectively. Most of the clean reads were distributed in the exon region, followed by intron region and intergenic region. Differently expressed (DE) genes were analyzed using edgeR software. 451 genes were differentially expressed between the infected and the non-infected groups. According to the comparison analysis, more genes were down-regulated in the non-infected samples than in those infected with FMDV.66 out of 451 genes were down-regulated, 385 out of 451 genes were up-regulated following FMDV infection. For function classification and pathway analysis, among 17741 assembled unigenes, there are 349 genes which are different genes of GO notes. Moreover, 49 genes were down-regulated, 300 genes were up-regulated associate with GO term. 1621 were successfully annotated by GO assignments, belonging to one or more of the three categories: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. According to KEGG analysis,the main pathway was represented including protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, phagosome, cell cycle and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. Some key DE genes related to immune process and signaling pathways were analyzed and quantified by RT-PCR. This is the first systematical transcriptome analysis of pig PBMCs infected by FMDV. These findings will help us better understand the host Cell-FMDV interaction and its relationship to pathogenesis, as well as contribute to the prevention and control of FMDV."

Epidemiology revealed that H6N2 viruses were the most frequently detected influenza subtypes in live bird markets from 2002 to 2008 in Eastern China, but from 2009 onwards, they were replaced with novel H6N6 viruses. We phylogenetically and antigenically analyzed 42 H6 viruses isolated mainly in domestic ducks from 2002 to 2010 in Eastern China. Surprisingly, none of these isolates grouped with the previously described H6N2 viruses which belonged to a single H6N2 virus lineage with a single gene constellation in domestic ducks in southern China from 2000 to 2005. Two distinct hemagglutinin lineages were identified and they all underwent frequent reassortment with multiple virus subtypes from the natural gene pool, but few reassortants were persistent or prevalent. Five subtypes of H6 influenza viruses (H6N1, H6N2, H6N5, H6N6 and H6N8) cocirculated in Eastern China, which form a significant part of the natural influenza virus reservoir in domestic ducks, and significant viral reassortment is still ongoing in this species."

Revealing the evolutionary and epidemiologic dynamics of CV-A16 across time and space is central to understanding its outbreak potential. In this study, we isolated six CV-A16 strains in China's Jilin province and construct a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree for CV-A16 VP1 gene by the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method using 708 strains from GenBank with epidemiological information. The evolution characteristics of CV-A16 VP1 gene was also analysed dynamicly through Bayesian skyline plot. All CV-A16 strains identified could be classified into five major genogroups, denoted by GI-GV. GIV and GV have co-circulated in China since 2007, and the CV-A16 epidemic strain isolated in the Jilin province, China, can be classified as GIV-3. The CV-A16 genogroups circulating recently in China have the same ancestor since 2007. The genetic diversity of the CV-A16 VP1 gene shows a continuous increase since the mid-1990s, with sharp increases in genetic diversity in 1997 and 2007 and reached peak in 2007. Very low genetic diversity existed after 2010. The CV-A16 VP1 gene evolutionary rate was 6.656E-3 substitutions per site per year. We predicted the dynamic phylogenetic trends, which indicate outbreak trends of CV-A16, and provide theoretical foundations for clinical prevention and treatment of HFMD which caused by a CV-A16."

The percentage values of RNA virus reads, compared to the total animal virus reads in each of the four strains were 96.96% (A), 97.30% (B), 98.01 (C), and 67.49% (D), and were mainly from Orthomyxoviridae, Mimiviridae, Bunyaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Reoviridae. Meanwhile, the minority of DNA virus reads were related to Herpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Iridoviridae, and other, low abundance viral families. The percentage values of Orthomyxoviridae, Mimiviridae, Bunyaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Herpesviridae reads were not significantly different among strains A, B, and C; however, there were marked differences in the abundance of these reads in strain D. In summary, this study provides an unbiased examination of the viral diversity in the feces of four strains of ducks in specific-pathogen-free periods, and highlights the variation in the percentage of viral families present. These results can be used as a reference for detecting duck viral pathogens and predicting zoonotic potential."

Comparative and phylogenetic analyses based on partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (ORF1b) demonstrated that the majority of ANV investigations were more closely related to the U.S. ANV strain (DQ324827-324836) than to the G-4260 (AB033998)."

These two strains had an 88.8% nucleotide sequence similarity and 97.9% deduced amino acid sequence homology. HEN0701 had high nucleotide sequence and high amino acid sequence identity with genotype I (GI) strains, while SH0601 had high nucleotide sequence and high amino acid sequence identity with GIII strains at both the gene and full genome levels. Further phylogenetic analysis showed that HEN0701 belonged to the JEV GI group and SH0601 was classified as a GIII strain. Analysis of codon usage showed there were a few differences between the GI and GIII strains in nucleotide composition and codon usage for the open reading frames."

Approximately 43% (202 samples) were BVDV-positive. Of the positive samples, 24 were chosen for further sequencing, sequence comparisons, and phylogenetic reconstructions. The phylogenetic reconstructions demonstrated that these isolates clustered into either BVDV1b (18 samples) or BVDV1c (six samples) subgenotypes. None of the isolates sequenced showed any cytopathic effect in culture. Unlike previously published studies in Chinese cattle, no BVDV2 genotypes were detected. These results indicate that the predominant subgenotypes in Xinjiang are BVDV1b and BVDV1c. This finding can be useful for further BVDV epidemiological study in China."

Here we report the discovery of the first Sicinivirus isolate (designated as strain JSY) of picornaviruses from commercial layer chickens in mainland China by using a viral metagenomics technique. This Sicinivirus isolate, which contains a whole genome of 9,797 nucleotides (nt) excluding the poly(A) tail, possesses one of the largest picornavirus genome so far reported, but only shares 88.83% and 82.78% of amino acid sequence identity to that of ChPV1 100C (KF979332) and Sicinivirus 1 strain UCC001 (NC_023861), respectively. The complete 939 nt 5'UTR of the isolate strain contains at least twelve stem-loop domains (A-L), representing the highest set of loops reported within Sicinivirus genus. The conserved 'barbell-like' structure was also present in the 272 nt 3'UTR of the isolate as that in the 3' UTR of Sicinivirus 1 strain UCC001. The 8,586 nt large open reading frame encodes a 2,862 amino acids polyprotein precursor. Moreover, Sicinivirus infection might be widely present in commercial chicken farms in Yancheng region of the Jiangsu Province as evidenced by all the tested stool samples from three different farms being positive (17/17) for Sicinivirus detection. This is the first report on identification of Sicinivirus in commercial layer chickens with a severe clinical disease in mainland China, however, further studies are needed to evaluate the pathogenic potential of this picornavirus in chickens."

In this study, the characteristics of codon usage bias (CUB) of the region between the two AUGs (the region-La) and of the same-sized region behind the second AUG (the region-Lb) in 94 different FMDV RNA sequences were analyzed using relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values. The results indicated that many codons with negative CUB were preferentially used in the region-La. There were two conserved residues (Thr and Cys) on the 4th and 6th residue positions of the region-La. The conserved residues had a general tendency to choose synonymous codons with negative CUB. Although most positions in the region-La did not contain conserved residues, many positions tended to use codons with negative CUB in this region. Among these codons, the majority belonged to the amino acids containing synonymous codons with clearly positive and negative CUB, including Asp, Val, Ile, Leu, Thr, Ala, Ser, Asn and Arg. The presence of many codons with negative CUB in the region-La might impair the efficiency of the first AUG selection. The phylogenetic incongruence of the region-La and the region-Lb implied that intertypic recombination played an important role in the evolution of FMDV. Furthermore, due to the existence of more positions with positive CUB and more widespread phylogenetic incongruence in the region-Lb than the region-La, a probable relationship between the degree of CUB and the evolution of the two target regions was revealed."

Transcription, translation, and splicing all hinge on the recognition of structured RNA elements by RNA-binding proteins. Models of RNAâprotein interactions are generally limited to short linear motifs and structures because of the vast sequence sampling required to access longer elements. Here, we develop an integrated approach that calculates global pairwise interaction scores from in vitro selection and high-throughput sequencing. We examine four RNA-binding proteins of phage, viral, and human origin. Our approach reveals regulatory motifs, discriminates between regulated and non-regulated RNAs within their native genomic context, and correctly predicts the consequence of mutational events on binding activity. We design binding elements that improve binding activity in cells and infer mutational pathways that reveal permissive versus disruptive evolutionary trajectories between regulated motifs. These coupling landscapes are broadly applicable for the discovery and characterization of proteinâRNA recognition at single nucleotide resolution.</jats:p>"

Real-time RT-PCR assays were developed to test fecal samples and to compare the prevalence and viral load in relation to health status, farms of origin and age groups. The results showed that PAstV4 (70.4%) was the dominant virus species, followed by PKoV (56.7%), PCV2 (42.2%), GCRV (3%) and GARV (0.9%). Diarrheic pigs had a higher viral load of PAstV4 in the nursery and growing-finishing groups. Rotaviruses were mainly detected in diarrheic pigs, whereas PCV2 was more often detected in clinically healthy than in diarrheic pigs, suggesting that most PCV2 infections were subclinical.

The miRNA expression profiles of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) of control TC pigs and those infected with PRRSV in vivo were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing to explore changes induced by infection. A total of 182 known miRNAs including 101 miRNA-5p and 81 miRNA-3p were identified with 23 up-regulated differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and 25 down-regulated DEmiRNAs. Gene Ontology analysis showed that predicted target genes for the DEmiRNAs were enriched in immune response, transcription regulation, and cell death. The integrative analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression revealed that down-regulated methylation-related genes (DNMT1 and DNMT3b) were targeted by five up-regulated DEmiRNAs. Furthermore, 35 pairs of miRNAs (70 miRNAs) were co-expressed after PRRSV infection and six pairs were co-expressed differently. Our results describe miRNA expression profiles of TC pigs in response to PRRSV infection and lay a strong foundation for developing novel therapies to control PRRS in pigs."

In recent years the number of new viruses within the family has had an explosive increase showing a high level of genetic diversity and a broad host range. In this report we describe two more circoviruses identified from bats in Yunnan and Heilongjiang provinces in China. Full genome sequencing has revealed that these bat associated circoviruses (bat ACV) should be classified as new species within the genus Circovirus based on the demarcation criteria of the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). The most striking result is the novel finding of a 21-28â¯nt polythymidine (poly-T) tract in the 3' terminal intergenic region of bat ACV isolates from Heilongjiang province. To understand its role in viral replication, a wild type bat ACV and a mutated version with the entire poly-T deleted were rescued through construction of infectious clones. Replication comparison in vitro showed that the poly-T is not essential for viral replication. Identification of additional bat ACV isolates and study of their biological characteristics will be the main task in future to understand the potential roles of bats in transmission of circoviruses to terrestrial mammals and humans."

This study attempted to characterize CRISPR-Cas systems in the disease-causing agent, Riemerella anatipestifer (R. anatipestifer). The CRISPR-Cas system provides adaptive immunity against foreign genetic elements in prokaryotes and CRISPR-cas loci extensively exist in the genomes of archaea and bacteria. However, the structure characteristics of R. anatipestifer CRISPR-Cas systems remains to be elucidated due to the limited availability of genomic data. To identify the structure and components associated with CRISPR-Cas systems in R. anatipestifer, we performed comparative genomic analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems in 25 R. anatipestifer strains using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that most of the R. anatipestifer strains (20/25) that were analyzed have two CRISPR loci (CRISPR1 and CRISPR2). CRISPR1 was shown to be flanked on one side by cas genes, while CRISPR2 was designated as an orphan. The other analyzed strains harbored only one locus, either CRISPR1 or CRISPR2. The length and content of consensus direct repeat sequences, as well as the length of spacer sequences associated with the two loci, differed from each other. Only three cas genes (cas1, cas2 and cas9) were located upstream of CRISPR1. CRISPR1 was also shown to be flanked by a 107Â bp-long putative leader sequence and a 16Â nt-long anti-repeat sequence. Combined with analysis of spacer organization similarity and phylogenetic tree of the R. anatipestifer strains, CRISPR arrays can be divided into different subgroups. The diversity of spacer organization was observed in the same subgroup. In general, spacer organization in CRISPR1 was more divergent than that in CRISPR2. Additionally, only 8Â % of spacers (13/153) were homologous with phage or plasmid sequences. The cas operon flanking CRISPR1 was observed to be relatively conserved based on multiple sequence alignments of Cas amino acid sequences. The phylogenetic analysis associated with Cas9 showed Cas9 sequence from R. anatipestifer was closely related to that of Bacteroides fragilis and formed part of the subtype II-C subcluster. Our data revealed for the first time the structural features of R. anatipestifer CRISPR-Cas systems. The illumination of structural features of CRISPR-Cas system may assist in studying the specific mechanism associated with CRISPR-mediated adaptive immunity and other biological functions in R. anatipestifer."

          <jats:p>Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are maintained mainly in wild birds, and despite frequent spillover infections of avian IAVs into mammals, only a small number of viruses have become established in mammalian hosts. A new H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV) of avian origin emerged in Asia in the mid-2000s and is now circulating in dog populations of China and South Korea, and possibly in Thailand. The emergence of CIV provides new opportunities for zoonotic infections and interspecies transmission. We examined 14,764 complete IAV genomes together with all CIV genomes publicly available since its first isolation until 2013. We show that CIV may have originated as early as 1999 as a result of segment reassortment among Eurasian and North American avian IAV lineages. We also identified amino acid changes that might have played a role in CIV emergence, some of which have not been previously identified in other cross-species jumps. CIV evolves at a lower rate than H3N2 human influenza viruses do, and viral phylogenies exhibit geographical structure compatible with high levels of local transmission. We detected multiple intrasubtypic and heterosubtypic reassortment events, including the acquisition of the NS segment of an H5N1 avian influenza virus that had previously been overlooked. In sum, our results provide insight into the adaptive changes required by avian viruses to establish themselves in mammals and also highlight the potential role of dogs to act as intermediate hosts in which viruses with zoonotic and/or pandemic potential could originate, particularly with an estimated dog population of â¼700 million.</jats:p>

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Influenza A viruses circulate in humans and animals. This multihost ecology has important implications, as past pandemics were caused by IAVs carrying gene segments of both human and animal origin. Adaptive evolution is central to cross-species jumps, and this is why understanding the evolutionary processes that shape influenza A virus genomes is key to elucidating the mechanisms underpinning viral emergence. An avian-origin canine influenza virus (CIV) has recently emerged in dogs and is spreading in Asia. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of CIV and show that it originated from both Eurasian and North American avian lineages. We also identified the mutations that might have been responsible for the cross-species jump. Finally, we provide evidence of multiple reassortment events between CIV and other influenza viruses (including an H5N1 avian virus). This is a cause for concern, as there is a large global dog population to which humans are highly exposed.

These isolates were characterized by pathogenic assays and phylogenetic analysis. The results showed that all NDV isolates except one were velogenic and virulent for chickens. These four virulent strains for chickens possess the amino acid sequence (112)R/K-R-Q-K/R-R-F(117) in the F(0) cleavage site which is typical of velogenic NDV. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these isolates belong to genotype VII and were closely related to the strains which were isolated from NDV outbreaks in chickens since 2000. One isolate of NDV from house sparrow belong to genotype II and was proved to be vaccine strain (Chicken/U.S./LaSota/46). The result of this study proved that house sparrow can carry the virulent NDV strains and the same genotype of viruses that are circulating in poultry are existing in house sparrows living around poultry farm in southern China.

Cells with malfunction of bta-miR-192 were established using transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology. Finally, bta-miR-192 mutant cells were screened for differentially expressed genes using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). The results showed that miR192 significantly decreased in cells exposed to E. coli F18ac and E. coli K88ac. The RNA-seq results showed that 1673 differentially expressed transcripts were identified; 890 genes were upregulated and 775 genes were downregulated. With the gene ontology enrichment analysis, 431 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were classified into 937 gene ontology terms. The pathway enrichment analysis showed that 535 genes were involved in 254 pathway terms. Interestingly, most of these DEGs were associated with the pathways in cancers or infectious diseases. When the selected DEGs (nâ=â162) in these pathways were intersected with 120 differential transcripts, 11 DEGs were identified. Subsequently, several genes associated with regulation, cancers, or viral infections, such as LEF1, AXIN2, MX1, and FCGR2B, were identified among the DEGs using functional analysis. Furthermore, associations between bta-miR-192 and DEGs were detected by intersecting the bta-miR-192's target genes with the DEGs, indicating that three genes including CBL, DICER1 and TRERF1 were involved in this relationship.

Based on the poultry-related environmental surveillance data in mainland China from 2013 to 2016, a total of 68 representative environment isolates were selected and further investigated systematically. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Y280-like H9N2 viruses have been predominant during 2013-2016 and acquired multiple specific amino acid substitutions that might favor viral transmission from avian to mammalians. Additionally, the viruses have undergone dramatic evolution and reassortment, resulting in an increased genetic diversity or acting as the gene contributors to new avian viruses. Receptor-binding tests indicated that most of the H9N2 isolates bound to human-type receptor, making them easily cross the species barrier and infect human efficiently. Our results suggested that the H9N2 AIVs prevalent in poultry may pose severe public health threat."

A panel of 123 rabies viruses obtained from the two host species between 1980 and 2006 were characterised by nucleotide sequencing of the cytoplasmic domain of the glycoprotein gene and the non-coding G-L intergenic region. Through phylogenetic analysis a viral cluster specific to black-backed jackals and spanning a 5-year period was delineated in western Limpopo. Virus strains associated with domestic dogs prevail in densely populated communal areas in north-eastern Limpopo and in south and eastern Mpumalanga. The data presented in this study indicated the likelihood that black-backed jackals are capable of sustaining rabies cycles independent of domestic dogs. It is proposed that wildlife rabies control strategies, in synergy with domestic animal vaccination should be considered for effective control of rabies in South Africa."

          <jats:p>
            Avian keratin disorder (AKD), characterized by debilitating overgrowth of the avian beak, was first documented in black-capped chickadees (
            <jats:italic>Poecile atricapillus</jats:italic>
            ) in Alaska. Subsequently, similar deformities have appeared in numerous species across continents. Despite the widespread distribution of this emerging pathology, the cause of AKD remains elusive. As a result, it is unknown whether suspected cases of AKD in the afflicted species are causally linked, and the impacts of this pathology at the population and community levels are difficult to evaluate. We applied unbiased, metagenomic next-generation sequencing to search for candidate pathogens in birds affected with AKD. We identified and sequenced the complete coding region of a novel picornavirus, which we are calling poecivirus. Subsequent screening of 19 AKD-affected black-capped chickadees and 9 control individuals for the presence of poecivirus revealed that 19/19 (100%) AKD-affected individuals were positive, while only 2/9 (22%) control individuals were infected with poecivirus. Two northwestern crows (
            <jats:italic>Corvus caurinus</jats:italic>
            ) and two red-breasted nuthatches (
            <jats:italic>Sitta canadensis</jats:italic>
            ) with AKD-consistent pathology also tested positive for poecivirus. We suggest that poecivirus is a candidate etiological agent of AKD.

            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>
            Avian keratin disorder (AKD) is an increasingly common disease of wild birds. This disease, characterized by beak overgrowth, was first described in the late 1990s and has been spreading rapidly both geographically and in terms of host species affected. AKD decreases host fitness and can be fatal. However, the cause of the disease has remained elusive, and its impact on host populations is poorly understood. We found a novel and divergent picornavirus in 19/19 AKD-affected black-capped chickadees that we examined but in only 2/9 control cases. We also found this virus in 4 individuals of 2 other passerine species that exhibited symptoms consistent with AKD. Our data suggest that this novel picornavirus warrants further investigation as the causative agent of AKD.
