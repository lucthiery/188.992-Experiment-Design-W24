Data Preprocessing: 

Currently there is only pmid used to create the calicum_preprocessed.csv dataset 
Can be used for further programming (perhaps filter entries with no abstract, can be done with new_data = calcium_preprocessed[calcium_preprocessed['abstracts'] != 'No abstract']


Next step is to start an analysis, why abstract is missing in 100 entries (maybe there is none) or if it can be included with other ids 
Then we will add an if clause to use the other ids if there is a NA entry in pmid 
With this we can create the datasets depression and virus better.
